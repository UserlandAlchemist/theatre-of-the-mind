# Monsters

## General

### Game Statistics (Monsters)

Monsters are described by the following statistics.

#### Armour Class (AC)

The monster’s ability to avoid damage in combat.

**Ascending AC:** The optional AAC score is listed afterwards in square brackets.

#### Hit Dice (HD)

The number of d8s rolled to determine an individual’s hit points.

**Asterisks:** One or more asterisks after the HD number indicate the number of special abilities the monster has, for the purpose of XP calculation (see  **Awarding XP**).

**Hit point modifiers:** Modifiers to the HD (e.g. +3, -1) are applied to the hp total after rolling the specified number of d8s. Monsters with a hit point modifier are treated specially by some spells.

**Fractional Hit Dice:** Some monsters are listed as having less than one HD, either as {{1/2}} (roll 1d4) or as a fixed number of hp.

**Average hit points:** The average hit point value is listed in parentheses.

### Attacks Usable Per Round (Att)

The attacks that the monster can use each round, with the inflicted damage in parentheses. (Note that monsters’ attack and damage rolls are not modified by STR or DEX, unless specified.)

**Alternative attack routines:** Are noted with “or” or square brackets.

#### Saving Throw Values (SV)

The monster’s saving throw values:

* **D:** Death/poison.
* **W:** Wands.
* **P:** Paralysis/petrification.
* **B:** Breath attacks.
* **S:** Spells/rods/staves.

**Save as HD:** The HD at which the monster saves is listed in parentheses (with NH indicating that it saves as a normal human). This is usually the monster’s HD rating, but sometimes differs:

* **Unintelligent monsters:** Typically save at half their HD rating.
* **Magical monsters:** May save at a higher HD rating.
* **Character classes:** Some monsters save as a character class. In this case, the class and level are listed.

#### Attack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0)

The monster’s ability to hit foes in combat, determined by its Hit Dice (see the **Attack Matrix** table under **Combat Tables**).

**Attack bonus:** The monster’s attack bonus (required when using the optional rule for Ascending AC) is listed afterwards in square brackets.

### Movement Rate (MV)

The speed at which the monster can move. Every monster has a **base movement rate** and an **encounter movement rate** (noted in parentheses, one third of the base movement rate).

**Modes of movement:** If the monster has multiple modes of movement (e.g. walking, flying, climbing), they are listed individually, separated by slashes.

#### Morale Rating (ML)

The monster’s likelihood to persist in battle. See **Morale**.

#### Alignment (AL)

The monster’s affiliation to Law, Neutrality, or Chaos. If “any” is listed, the referee may roll randomly or choose the creature’s alignment.

#### XP Award (XP)

Pre-calculated XP award for defeating the monster.

#### Number Appearing (NA)

Listed as two values, the second in parentheses.

**Zeros:** If the first value is a zero, monsters of this type are not usually encountered in dungeons. If the second value is a zero, monsters of this type are not usually encountered in the wilderness and do not usually have lairs.

**Usage:** The use of these values depends on the situation in which monsters are encountered:

* **Wandering monsters in a dungeon:** The first value determines the number of monsters encountered roaming in a dungeon level equal to their HD. If the monster is encountered on a level greater than its HD, the number appearing may be increased; if encountered on a level less than its HD, the number appearing should be reduced.
* **Monster lair in a dungeon:** The second value lists the number of monsters found in a lair in a dungeon.
* **Wandering monsters in the wilderness:** The second value indicates the number of monsters encountered roaming in the wilderness.
* **Monster lair in the wilderness:** The second value multiplied by 5 indicates the number of monsters found in a lair in the wilderness.

#### Treasure Type (TT)

The letter code used to determine the amount and type of treasure possessed by the monster(s) (see **Treasure Types**). The letters listed are used as follows:

* **A to O:** Indicate a hoard: the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters, usually hidden in the lair. For monsters with a lair encounter size (see **#Number Appearing (NA)|#Number Appearing**) of greater than 1d4, the amount of treasure in the hoard may be reduced, if the number of monsters is below average.
* **P to V:** If listed for an intelligent monster, indicate treasure carried by individuals (P to T) or a group (U, V). If listed for an unintelligent monster, indicate treasure from the bodies of its victims.

## General Monster Notes

### Infravision

All non-human monsters have infravision (see **Darkness** under **Hazards and Challenges**). Unless specified in a monster’s description, this allows monsters to see in the dark up to 60’.

### Languages

20% of intelligent monsters speak Common (see **Languages**), unless the monster description states otherwise. Many intelligent monster species also have their own tongue.

### Persons

Some spells or magical effects only affect creatures classified as “persons”. This includes all humans and demihumans, as well as human-like monsters of up to 4+1 HD. The referee should decide which monsters are affected (a suggested list is given below).

The following monsters are classified as “persons”, for the sake of magical effects: acolyte, bandit, berserker, brigand, buccaneer, bugbear, dervish, dryad, dwarf, elf, gnoll, gnome, goblin, halfling, hobgoblin, kobold, lizard man, medium, merchant, merman, neanderthal, nixie, noble, nomad, normal human, ogre, orc, pirate, pixie, sprite, trader, troglodyte, veteran.

## Dungeon Encounters

This section provides encounter tables by dungeon level, using standard monsters. Referees who are using additional (or alternative) monsters should either adapt the tables to include these, or should create their own encounter tables. Special tables may also be created to reflect the different balance of monsters inhabiting a specific dungeon.

### How to Roll an Encounter

Roll 1d20 and look up the result on the column in the table below that corresponds to the dungeon level being explored. The result indicates the monster encountered, with the number appearing in parentheses.

### Notes

**NPC adventurers:** Encounters with NPC adventuring parties are listed in the tables as “Basic Adventurers” or “Expert Adventurers”. Guidelines for generating NPC adventurers can be found under **Adventuring Parties**.

**Number appearing:** The values listed in the tables for some monsters do not match the values listed in the monster description. If desired, the referee may use the number appearing value listed in the monster description, for consistency.

## Wilderness Encounters

This section provides encounter tables by terrain type, using the standard monsters. Referees who are using additional (or alternative) monsters should either adapt the tables to include these, or should create their own encounter tables.

### How to Roll an Encounter

Roll 1d8 and 1d12:

* Look up the d8 result on the column in the table below that corresponds to the terrain being explored. The result indicates which sub-table to consult.
* Look up the d12 result in the sub-table indicated.

### Notes

**Aerial encounters:** Always use the **Flyer** table, in sub-table 1.

**Lost World:** In Lost World or prehistoric settings, any Animal result may be rolled on the **Prehistoric Animal** table, in sub-table 2.

**NPC adventurers:** Encounters with NPC adventuring parties are listed in the tables as “Basic Adventurers”, “Expert Adventurers”, “High-Level Cleric”, “High-Level Fighter”, or “High-Level Magic-User”. Guidelines for generating NPC adventurers can be found under **Adventuring Parties**.

## Adventuring Parties

This procedure generates parties of NPC adventurers. As the procedure is fairly involved, referees may wish to pre-generate some NPC parties for use in random encounters. The following general details apply to all types of NPC party described:

* **Spells:** If spell casters are present, choose or roll their memorized spells.
* **Equipment:** Normal adventuring gear.
* **Treasure:** Treasure types U + V, shared among the group.
* **Marching order:** Decided by referee.

If the classes presented in this document are not in use, the referee should replace the listed classes by equivalents in use in the campaign.

### Basic Adventurers

* **Composition:** 1d4+4 characters of random class and level (see below).
* **Alignment:** Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.

### Expert Adventurers

* **Composition:** 1d6+3 characters of random class and level (see below).
* **Alignment:** Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.
* **Mounts:** 75% chance of being mounted, in the wilderness.
* **Magic items:** Per individual: there is a chance of the NPC having a magic item from each suitable magic item sub-table (see **Magic Items**). The chance per sub-table is 5% per level of the NPC. Rolled items that cannot be used by the NPC should be ignored (no re-roll).

### High-Level Cleric

A high-level cleric and party. (Mounts and magic items as per **#Expert Adventurers**.)

* **Composition:** Leader (cleric of level 1d6+6), 1d4 clerics (level 1d4+1), 1d3 fighters (level 1d6).
* **Alignment:** Roll for the whole party.

### High-Level Fighter

A high-level fighter and a group of retainers, often on their way to or from war. (Mounts and magic items as per **#Expert Adventurers**.)

* **Composition:** Leader (fighter of level 1d4+6), 2d4 retainers (level 1d4+2, any class).
* **Alignment:** Roll for the whole party.

### High-Level Magic-User

A high-level magic-user, accompanied by their apprentices and a group of hired guards, often on a quest for arcane lore. (Mounts and magic items as per **#Expert Adventurers**.)

* **Composition:** Leader (magic-user of level 1d4+6), 1d4 apprentices (magic-users of level 1d3), 1d4 mercenaries (fighters of level 1d4+1).
* **Alignment:** Roll the leader’s alignment. The apprentices have the same alignment as the leader, but the mercenaries may be of different alignment.

### NPC Adventurer Class and Level

| d8 | Class      | Level (Basic) | Level (Expert) |
|----|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1  | Cleric     | 1d3           | 1d6+3          |
| 2  | Dwarf      | 1d3           | 1d6+6          |
| 3  | Elf        | 1d3           | 1d6+2          |
| 4  | Fighter    | 1d3           | 1d6+3          |
| 5  | Fighter    | 1d3           | 1d6+5          |
| 6  | Halfling   | 1d3           | 1d6+2          |
| 7  | Magic-User | 1d3           | 1d6+3          |
| 8  | Thief      | 1d3           | 1d6+4          |

### NPC Adventurer Alignment

| d6  | Alignment |
|-----|-----------|
| 1–2 | Lawful    |
| 3–4 | Neutral   |
| 5–6 | Chaotic   |

## Stronghold Encounters

When PCs wander into the vicinity of the wilderness stronghold of a high-level NPC, a warm reception is not always guaranteed. These guidelines may be used if the referee does not have specific notes on a stronghold’s ruler and guard patrols.

### Ruler

The referee should decide what class of NPC claims ownership of the stronghold and the surrounding lands:

* **Cleric:** Of level 1d8+6.
* **Fighter:** Of level 1d6+8.
* **Magic-user:** Of level 1d4+10.

Demihuman strongholds are unusual cases, and should be detailed in advance by the referee. Typically, they will attempt to avoid all contact with travellers.

### Patrols

Strangers in the lands around a stronghold will typically be spotted by mercenary groups hired to patrol the lands. The type of troops depends on the ruler’s class:

* **Cleric:** 2d6 medium horsemen. Equipped with chainmail (AC 5 [14]) and lances. Morale 9.
* **Fighter:** 2d6 heavy horsemen. Equipped with plate mail (AC 3 [16]), lances, and swords. Morale 9.
* **Magic-user:** 2d6 heavy footmen. Equipped with chainmail + shield (AC 4 [15]) and swords. Morale 8.

### Garrison

Patrols such as those described are only a small part of the ruler’s garrison. Further forces may include magical monsters or humans mounted on flying creatures.

### Reaction to Travellers

The reaction of the ruler to travellers in their domain depends on the class of the ruler and can be determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting this table:

| d6 | Cleric | Fighter | Magic-User |
|----|--------|---------|------------|
| 1  | Chase  | Chase   | Chase      |
| 2  | Chase  | Chase   | Ignore     |
| 3  | Ignore | Chase   | Ignore     |
| 4  | Ignore | Ignore  | Ignore     |
| 5  | Invite | Ignore  | Ignore     |
| 6  | Invite | Invite  | Invite     |

**Chase:** The patrol is instructed to chase intruders out of the domain. Alternatively, they may demand a toll from travellers passing through. The exact price demanded depends on the ruler’s character, the apparent wealth of the PCs, etc. If the PCs refuse to pay the toll, the patrol may attack them, drive them away, or attempt to take them prisoner.

**Ignore:** The patrol leaves the PCs to go about their business.

**Invite:** The patrol brings a message from the domain’s ruler, inviting the PCs to stay in the stronghold. The ruler’s exact motive for doing so will depend on their personality—it is not necessarily benign.
