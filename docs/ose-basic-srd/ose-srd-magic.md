## Rules of Magic

Some character classes have the ability to memorize and cast magical spells. A spell consists of a pattern of magical energy memorized in a character’s mind. When a spell is cast, the spell is erased from the character’s mind until it is memorized again.

**Arcane and divine magic:** Spells are either granted by a deity or higher power (**divine magic**) or learned by esoteric study (**arcane magic**). The differences between the two types of magic are described opposite.

**Spell list:** The character’s class determines which spells they can cast. Each class has an associated list of spells.

**Spells in memory:** The character’s level determines how many spells they can memorize at one time.

**Reversible spells:** Certain spells are reversible, having two possible opposite effects (e.g. healing or harming). This is noted in each spell’s description.

### Memorizing Spells

**Rest and time requirements:** A spell caster can memorize new spells once a day, after an uninterrupted night’s sleep. Spell memorization (up to the maximum number the character can memorize) takes one hour.

**Duplicate spells:** Characters able to memorize multiple spells of a given level may opt to memorize the same spell twice. This results in two copies of the spell’s magical energy pattern, one of which is erased each time the spell is cast.

### Casting Spells

A memorized spell may be cast by precisely replicating the required sequence of hand motions and magic words.

**Once only:** When a spell is cast, the magical energy pattern in the caster’s mind is erased until the spell is memorized again.

**Freedom:** The character must be able to replicate the hand motions and magic words required by the spell. A spell caster cannot cast spells if bound, gagged, or magically silenced.

**Line of sight:** Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a selected character, monster, object, or area) must be visible to the caster.

### Spell Effects

**Selecting targets:** Some spells affect multiple targets, either by area or by Hit Dice total. If the spell description does not specify how targets are selected, the referee must decide whether they are selected randomly, by the caster, etc.

**Concentration:** Some spells specify that the caster must concentrate in order to maintain the magical effect. Unless the spell description states otherwise, performing any other action or being distracted (e.g. attacked) causes concentration to end.

**Cumulative effects:** Certain spells grant bonuses (or penalties) to game statistics such as attack rolls, AC, damage rolls, saving throws, movement rate, attacks per round, etc. Multiple spells affecting the same game statistic do not combine. Spell effects can combine with magical items effects, however.

### Arcane Magic

#### Memorizing Spells

Arcane spell casters memorize spells by studying spell books (see **Spell Books**) and are thus limited to choosing from the spells in their spell book, which must be at hand.

#### Reversing Spells

The normal or reversed form of a spell must be selected when the spell is memorized. Both forms of a spell may be memorized if the character is able to memorize more than one spell of the given level.

### Divine Magic

#### Memorizing Spells

Divine spell casters memorize spells by praying to the deity or higher power they worship. When praying for spells, divine spell casters may choose any spells in their class’ spell list that they are of high enough level to cast.

#### Reversing Spells

Divine spell casters can cast the reversed version of a spell by speaking the words and performing the gestures backwards when it is cast.

#### Deity Disfavour

Divine spell casters must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment, clergy, and religion. Deities may punish characters who fall from favour. The referee must determine appropriate measures, for example a –1 attack roll penalty, a decrease in available spells, or being sent on a perilous quest. In order to regain favour, the character must perform some great deed for their deity (as determined by the referee), for example: donating magic items or gold, constructing a temple, converting many people to the religion, vanquishing a powerful enemy of the deity, etc.

#### Spells and Deity Alignment

A divine spell caster may draw disfavour from their deity when casting spells (or their reversed versions) whose effects go against the deity’s alignment:

* **Lawful characters:** Will only use reversed spells in dire circumstances.
* **Chaotic characters:** Will usually use reversed spells, only using the normal versions of spells to benefit allies of their religion.
* **Neutral characters:** Will favour either normal or reversed spells, depending on the deity served (no deity favours both reversed and normal spells).

## Spell Books

Arcane spell casters record the spells that they know in a spell book.

**Number of spells:** A character’s spell book contains exactly the number of spells that the character is capable of memorizing (as determined by the character’s class and level).

### Beginning Spells

Arcane spell casters begin play with as many spells in their spell book as they are able to memorize. The referee may choose these spells or may allow the player to select.

### Adding Spells

When the number of spells an arcane spell caster can memorize increases (e.g. by gaining an experience level), they can increase the selection of spells in their spell book. In this way, the number of spells in the spell book may be brought in line with the number of spells the character can memorize. This is possible in two ways:

* **Mentoring:** The character may consult an arcane guild or mentor to learn new spells. This process takes about a week of game time. The spells a character learns in this way are determined by the referee, who may decide to let the player choose.
* **Research:** It is also possible to add spells to a spell book by means of ''Magical Research''.

### Lost Spell Books

An arcane spell caster can rewrite spells if their spell book is lost or destroyed:

* **Cost:** The cost per spell to be recovered is 1 week of game time and 1,000gp per level of the spell. For example, rewriting one 1st level spell and one 2nd level spell takes 3 weeks and 3,000gp.
* **Sole activity:** Rewriting spell books requires complete focus. The character cannot do anything else during this period.

### Captured Spell Books

Without the use of magic (e.g. ''read magic''), a spell book can only be read by its owner.

## Magical Research

Many spell casting character classes can also perform research into new spells, magic items, and other magical effects, as noted in the class description. This requires time, monetary outlay, and sometimes rare and unusual ingredients.

### Chance of Failure

All forms of magical research have a minimum 15% chance of failure. If the research fails, the money and time invested are lost.

### Creating New Spells

The player must write up the spell they wish to create and show the referee. The referee then decides what level the spell will be and may request changes (or deem the spell impossible to research).

#### Restrictions

The character can only research spells of a level they are able to cast.

#### Cost and Time

Researching a new spell takes two weeks per spell level and 1,000gp per spell level.

### Creating Magic Items

The player must write up the item they wish to create and show the referee. The referee then decides what materials are required and may request changes (or deem the item impossible to research).

#### Restrictions

**Divine spell casters:** May only create items that they are able to use themselves.

**Arcane spell casters:** May create any item except those that may only be used by divine spell casters.

#### Materials

Creating magic items often requires rare components such as expensive gems or body parts of monsters or rare animals. Often, adventures will be required just to acquire these materials.

#### Cost and Time

**Duplicating spell effects:** Single-use items (e.g. scrolls, potions) that recreate the effects of a spell cost 1 week per spell level and 500gp per spell level.

**Multi-use items:** If the item created can replicate a spell effect multiple times (for example a wand with charges), the cost in time and money is multiplied by the number of uses.

**Other items:** The referee must judge the requirements for creating items that do not recreate the effects of a spell. More powerful items should require more time, money, and special materials or quests. Some examples: 20 arrows +1 (10,000gp, 1 month), plate mail +1 (10,000gp, 6 months), crystal ball (30,000gp, 6 months), ring of x-ray vision (100,000gp, 1 year).

### Other Magical Research

Characters who are able to research spells or magic items may also attempt to research other magical processes. For example, a character may wish to sanctify a holy site or create magical traps, constructs, or portals.

As with magic item creation, the referee decides the time and cost of the research. The following may also be required:

* The casting of certain, specific spells.
* Rare ingredients.
* In some cases, it may also be necessary to periodically repeat the ritual to renew the magical effect.
