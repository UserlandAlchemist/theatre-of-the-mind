# Adventures

## Party Organisation

**Size:** The ideal size of a group is between 6 and 8 characters—large enough to confront the challenges of the adventure, while not so large as to be disorganised. If not enough PCs are present, the players may wish to hire retainers (see *Retainers*).

**Classes:** It is wise for a party to consist of a mix of characters of different adventuring classes. Combat-focused characters are essential for protecting the group from danger, while other classes each have magic or other special abilities which are useful for handling different situations that may arise in an adventure.

**Level:** As new PCs join play, the experience levels of the characters in the party may diverge. It is recommended that characters more than four levels apart should adventure separately, as challenges and rewards suitable to characters of greatly different experience levels do not match.

### Marching Order

Before starting an adventure, the players should determine the normal arrangement of their PCs when exploring. This is known as the party’s **marching order**. For example, players may decide to move in a two-column formation, with well-armoured characters in front, weaker characters in the middle, and a rear guard. The group may define different standard marching orders for common situations (e.g. standard exploration, combat, opening doors, searching, etc.).

### The Caller

If the players wish to, they may nominate one of their number as the spokesperson of the group, known as the caller. This player is responsible for informing the referee about the actions and movements of the party as a whole. Delegating this role to one player—rather than having each player informing the referee about their PC’s individual actions—can speed up play.

The caller’s character usually takes on the role of party leader and should thus have a high Charisma score and be located near to the front of the party.

### The Mapper

One player should create a map of the areas being explored, based on the referee’s descriptions. Details such as monsters or traps encountered, clues to puzzles, or possibly interesting unexplored areas may be noted on the map as it is drawn.

### Dividing Treasure

The spoils of an adventure may be divided between surviving characters in whatever way the players agree on.

**Non-magical treasure:** Is typically divided evenly between player characters.

**Magic items:** The players must decide which character keeps each item. One method for doing this is for each player to roll a die and compare the results. The highest rolling player gets to pick a magic item first, the second highest rolling player gets the next pick, and so on.

## Time, Weight, Movement

### Tracking Time

When an adventure is under way, the referee should keep track of the time that elapses in the imagined world, known as **game time**. This is distinct from **real time**: what may take the players and referee mere seconds to describe may take PCs hours or even days to complete.

For example, when characters are exploring a dungeon, the referee tracks the number of turns that have elapsed; when characters are exploring the wilderness, the number of days elapsed is tracked.

The referee must adjudicate what may be accomplished in a given period of time.

#### Resources

As game time passes, the referee should pay attention to resources that the party consumes. For example: food, water, fuel for light sources, durations of spells or magical effects, etc.

### Tracking Movement

As player characters explore the imagined world, the referee should keep track of their location on a prepared map. The map is usually kept secret from the players, who must rely on the referee’s descriptions of the areas they explore.

To determine how long it takes for characters to move from one area to the next, the referee should refer to the characters’ movement rates (see **Game Statistics**).

#### Group Movement Rate

An adventuring party will usually want to stay together. The movement rate of the party as a whole is determined by the speed of the slowest member.

### Measurements

#### Time: Rounds and Turns

Aside from everyday time increments (minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game.

**Turns:** 10 minutes of game time. There are 6 turns in an hour. Time is measured in turns when exploring dungeons (see **Dungeon Adventuring**).

**Rounds:** 10 seconds of game time. There are 60 rounds in a turn. Time is measured in rounds during encounters, especially in combat (see **Encounters** and **Combat**).

#### Distance: Inches, Feet, Yards, Miles

Staying true to its origins, this game uses imperial or customary US units. Distances are measured in inches (notated with a ”), feet (notated with a ’), yards, and miles.

#### Distance Conversions

* 1 foot = 12 inches
* 1 yard = 3 feet
* 1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet

#### Weight: Coins

Weight measures typically come into play only when discussing how much characters can carry (see **Encumbrance** below). As coins are the most common form of treasure found by adventurers, all weights are measured in coins. (Ten coins are equivalent to one pound.)

### Encumbrance (Optional Rule)

Some groups may wish to use a system to track the amount of gear and treasure a character can carry and how this affects their movement rate.

#### Tracking Encumbrance

Encumbrance is a measure of both the weight and bulk a character is carrying.

**Treasure:** The encumbrance of treasure carried by a character should be tracked. The encumbrance of common items of treasure is shown in the table below. The referee should decide the weight of other forms of treasure.

**Equipment:** Two options for tracking the encumbrance of characters’ equipment are presented below. The same system should be applied to all characters.

**Maximum load:** The maximum load any character can carry is 1,600 coins of weight. Characters carrying more than this cannot move.

#### Treasure Encumbrance in Coins

| Treasure          | Weight in Coins |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Coin (any type)   | 1               |
| Gem               | 1               |
| Jewellery (1 piece) | 10            |
| Potion            | 10              |
| Rod               | 20              |
| Scroll            | 1               |
| Staff             | 40              |
| Wand              | 10              |

#### Option 1: Basic Encumbrance

**Treasure:** The weight of treasure carried is tracked to make sure that the character’s maximum load is not exceeded.

**Equipment:** The weight of armour, weapons, and adventuring gear is not tracked and does not count towards a character’s maximum load.

**Movement rate:** Is determined by the type of armour the character is wearing and whether they are carrying a significant amount of treasure (as judged by the referee). The actual weight of the treasure carried does not affect movement rate.

#### Basic Encumbrance

| Armour Worn   | Without Treasure | Carrying Treasure |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Unarmoured    | 120’ (40’)       | 90’ (30’)         |
| Light armour  | 90’ (30’)        | 60’ (20’)         |
| Heavy armour  | 60’ (20’)        | 30’ (10’)         |

#### Option 2: Detailed Encumbrance

**Treasure:** The weight of coins and other treasure carried is tracked.

**Equipment:** The weight of the character’s armour and weapons is also tracked (the weight of these items is listed in the equipment list). Miscellaneous adventuring gear (backpack, spikes, sacks, etc.) may be counted as 80 coins of weight.

**Movement rate:** The character’s movement rate is based on the total weight of all significant items carried, including treasure, weapons, and armour.

#### Detailed Encumbrance

| Encumbrance        | Movement Rate |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Up to 400 coins    | 120’ (40’)    |
| Up to 600 coins    | 90’ (30’)     |
| Up to 800 coins    | 60’ (20’)     |
| Up to 1,600 coins  | 30’ (10’)     |

## Checks, Damage, Saves

### Ability Checks

The referee may use a character’s ability scores to determine the character’s chance of succeeding at various challenging tasks.

#### Rolling an Ability Check

The player must roll 1d20 and try to get equal or under the appropriate ability score. A result greater than the ability score is a failure.

#### Modifiers

The referee may apply modifiers to the roll, depending on the difficulty of the task: a –4 modifier for an easy task or +4 for a difficult task.

#### 1s and 20s

A natural 1 should be treated as a success and a natural 20 treated as a failure.

### Damage, Healing, and Death

All characters and monsters have a hit point total, which represents their ability to avoid death. Many attack forms, including attacks with weapons in combat, subtract hit points from this pool.

#### Death

A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.

#### Destruction of Items

If a character is killed by a destructive spell or special attack (e.g. a *lightning bolt* spell or a dragon’s breath), their equipment is assumed to be destroyed.

#### Destruction of Magic Items

Magic items in the possession of a character who is killed by a destructive spell or special attack may be allowed a chance to survive, as follows:

* **Save:** For each item, a saving throw may be made using the character’s saving throw values.
* **Bonuses:** Items that grant a bonus in combat (e.g. magical weapons and armour) may also apply this bonus to the saving throw.

#### Healing

**Natural:** For each full day of complete rest, a character or monster recovers 1d3 hit points. If the rest is interrupted, the character or monster will not heal that day.

**Magical:** Healing may also occur through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.

### Saving Throws

A saving throw is a roll made by a character or monster to resist a harmful special attack or magical effect.

#### Categories

There are five saving throw categories, used in the following situations:

* **Death or Poison (D):** When targeted by a death ray or exposed to poison.
* **Wands (W):** When targeted by an effect from a magical wand.
* **Paralysis or Petrification (P):** When targeted by an effect that paralyses or turns to stone.
* **Breath Attacks (B):** When targeted by the breath of a dragon (or other monster with a breath attack).
* **Spells, Rods, or Staves (S):** When targeted by a baneful spell or an effect from a magical rod or staff.

#### When to Roll a Saving Throw

The description of a monster, spell, magic item, or other effect indicates when a saving throw should be rolled and which category is to be saved against.

#### Saving Throw Tables

**Characters:** Each character class has its own table denoting the saving throw values of characters of each experience level.

**Monsters:** Most monsters use the saving throw table under **Combat Tables**. Some monsters’ descriptions may note that they use the table for a specific character class.

#### Rolling a Saving Throw

The player or referee must roll 1d20 and try to get equal or over the appropriate saving throw value. A result less than the saving throw value is a failure.

#### Successful Saves

**Damaging effects:** A successful save against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved.

**Other effects:** A successful saving throw against an effect that does not cause damage means the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.

#### Saving Throws Versus Poison

**Failure:** A failed save against poison is usually fatal.

**Damage:** If a poisonous attack also inflicts damage, the damage is not affected by the success or failure of the saving throw.

## Hazards and Challenges

### Climbing

When climbing in a difficult or pressured situation, the referee may require a DEX check to avoid falling.

#### Sheer Surfaces

Very steep or sheer surfaces are normally impossible to climb without specialised equipment. Some characters may have class abilities which allow them to attempt to climb such surfaces unaided.

### Darkness

Characters will usually want to bring a source of light with them on underground expeditions. Typical light sources enable normal vision within a 30’ radius.

#### Infravision

All non-human monsters and many demihuman races have a special kind of vision that allows them to see in the dark. This is called infravision.

**Heat tones:** Characters with infravision can see heat tones, with warm objects (such as living creatures) appearing bright, cold objects as black, and cool objects as grey.

**Reading:** It is not possible to read in the dark with infravision, because fine detail cannot be perceived.

**Range:** Infravision works within a limited range (60’ for monsters, unless specified otherwise in a monster’s description).

**Disruption:** Visible light (normal or magical) and large heat sources prevent infravision from functioning.

#### Light and Surprise

Parties carrying a light in a dark environment usually cannot surprise others (see *Encounters*), because their presence is given away by the light.

### Falling

Falling from a height onto a hard surface inflicts 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen.

### Losing Direction

When travelling with a reliable guide, following a trail or river, or heading towards an obvious landmark, there is no risk of getting lost. Otherwise, there is a chance of getting lost in the untracked wilds.

The chance of the party becoming lost depends on the type of terrain being explored (see *Wilderness Adventuring* and *Waterborne Adventuring*).

#### Effects of Being Lost

If the party becomes lost, the referee will decide how far off course they are travelling (possibly at random). For example, if the party intends to head north, the referee may determine that they are actually heading northeast.

It may take some time for a lost party to realise that it is moving in the wrong direction.

### Starvation

Characters who go without food or water for a whole day or longer may begin to suffer penalties, at the referee’s discretion, for example: attack penalties, reduced movement rate, more frequent need to rest, or a slow loss of hit points.

### Swimming

**Movement rate:** Characters can swim at half their normal movement rate.

**Who can swim:** Unless there is an obvious reason why a character could not have learned to swim, it is assumed that all characters can swim.

#### Drowning

The circumstances in which drowning is a risk—as well as the chance of drowning—are judged by the referee.

**Example circumstances:** Swimming in treacherous water conditions, swimming while wearing armour or carrying heavy or awkward items, fighting in water.

**Example chances of drowning:** A character swimming in rough waters while wearing heavy armour and carrying a heavy load may have a 99% probability of drowning. A character in the same waters but wearing light armour and carrying a light load may only have a 10% probability of drowning.

### Wandering Monsters

Besides the monsters specifically placed in certain regions of a dungeon or wilderness, PCs may randomly encounter monsters on the move between areas. These are known as wandering monsters.

See *Dungeon Adventuring*, *Wilderness Adventuring*, and *Waterborne Adventuring* for specific details.

**Frequency:** The referee should roll periodically to determine whether a wandering monster is encountered. The frequency of checks depends on the type of area being explored.

**Chance:** When a wandering monster check is made, the chance of a random encounter is usually 1-in-6. This chance may vary, depending on the type of area being explored (e.g. dungeon region or level, type of wilderness terrain).

**Monster type:** Each area should have its own table of wandering monsters, which the referee rolls on when an encounter takes place.

**Noise or light:** If the party is making a lot of noise or carrying bright light sources in a dark environment, the referee may increase the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.

**Hiding:** If the party rests quietly in an out-of-the-way location, the referee may decrease the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.

## Dungeon Adventuring

### Sequence of Play Per Turn

* **Wandering monsters:** The referee makes checks as applicable.
* **Actions:** The party decides what action to take (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering rooms).
* **Description:** The referee describes what happens. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in **Encounters**.
* **End of turn:** The referee updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest.

### Doors

Doors are common in many dungeons, some hidden, some obvious, some locked, and some stuck.

#### Searching for Secret Doors

Some doors are hidden or concealed. Adventurers may choose to search a 10’ × 10’ area for secret doors. See **#Searching**.

**Chance of finding:** If a character is searching in the right location, there is a 1-in-6 chance of finding a secret door. (Some types of adventurers may have an increased chance.)

#### Stuck Doors

**Forcing:** The chance of forcing open a stuck door depends on the character’s Strength (see **Ability Scores**).

**Surprise:** A failed attempt to force open a door eliminates any possibility of surprise (see **Encounters**) that the party may have against any monsters on the other side of the door.

#### Locked Doors

Locks may be picked by a character proficient with lock picks or opened by magic.

#### Doors Swinging Shut

Doors opened by adventurers (by whatever means) are likely to swing shut after they pass. To prevent this, doors may be held open using iron spikes or other wedges.

#### Monsters and Doors

Monsters that live in the dungeon can usually open doors (even stuck doors), unless they are blocked, magically closed, or wedged shut with spikes.

#### Listening at Doors

**Chance of success:** PCs have a 1-in-6 chance of detecting subtle sounds beyond a door. (Some types of adventurers may have an increased chance of success.)

**Referee rolls:** The referee should always roll for the character listening so that the player never knows if the roll failed or if there simply is no sound behind the door.

**One chance:** Each character may only make one attempt to listen at each door.

**Silent monsters:** Some monsters (e.g. undead) cannot be detected by listening.

### Movement

**Exploring the unknown:** When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their **base movement rate in feet per turn**. This very slow rate of movement accounts for PCs exploring in a dark, unknown environment, moving carefully and stealthily, and mapping their progress.

**In familiar areas:** When PCs are moving through dungeon areas with which they are familiar, the referee may allow them to move at a faster rate. For example, the referee might allow PCs to move at three times their base movement rate per turn, when moving through familiar areas.

### Resting

**Frequency of rest:** Characters must rest for one turn every hour in the dungeon.

**Penalty for not resting:** A –1 penalty to attack and damage rolls is incurred until the characters rest for one turn.

### Searching

The following stipulations apply to searching for secret doors, room traps, and treasure traps.

**Time:** Searching takes one turn.

**Referee rolls:** The referee should always roll for the character searching, so that the player does not know if the roll failed or if there are simply no hidden features present.

**One chance:** Each character can only make one attempt to search a specific area or item.

### Traps

There are two kinds of traps:

* **Room traps:** Large traps that are designed to affect anyone who enters a certain area (e.g. a pit that opens in the floor when walked over).
* **Treasure traps:** Small traps placed on an item, to prevent it being tampered with or stolen (e.g. a poison needle on a chest or lock).

#### Triggering Traps

Each trap has a trigger—an action which causes it to spring (e.g. turning a door handle, walking into a specific area).

**Chance of triggering:** When a character performs the action that triggers a trap, there is a 2-in-6 chance of the trap being sprung.

**Trap damage:** Damage inflicted by a triggered trap is usually automatic, without an attack roll.

**Monsters:** Monsters may be able to bypass traps without risk, if the referee wishes.

#### Searching for Room Traps

Adventurers may choose to search a 10’ × 10’ area for room traps. If the search succeeds, the trap is discovered. See **#Searching**.

**Chance of finding:** If a character is searching in the right location, there is a 1-in-6 chance of finding a room trap. (Some types of adventurers may have an increased chance.)

#### Searching for Treasure Traps

Characters with the ability to find treasure traps (as noted in their class description) may choose to search items (e.g. chests, locks) for traps. See **#Searching**.

**Chance of finding:** The chance of finding treasure traps, if a character is searching in the right location, is noted in the character’s class description.

### Wandering Monsters

**Frequency:** A check is typically rolled once every two turns in the dungeon.

**Chance:** The typical chance of encountering a wandering monster is 1-in-6.

**Distance:** Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 × 10 feet away, moving in the direction of the party.

## Wilderness Adventuring

### Sequence of Play Per Day

* **Decide course:** The players decide on their course of travel for the day.
* **Losing direction:** The referee determines whether the party gets lost.
* **Wandering monsters:** The referee makes checks as applicable.
* **Description:** The referee describes the terrain passed through and any sites of interest that the party comes across, asking players for their actions, as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in **Encounters**.
* **End of day:** The referee updates time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest.

### Distance and Measurement

The open spaces of the wilderness mean that characters and monsters can move more freely than in a dungeon.

**Ranges and movement rates:** Are measured in yards, instead of feet. This means that ranges and movement rates are tripled.

**Areas:** Of spell effects, breath weapons, etc. are still measured in feet.

### Flying

**Miles per day:** The distance a creature can fly in a day is double the distance it can travel overland (see **#Overland Travel**). For example, a creature with a movement rate of 120’ could travel 24 miles in a day overland, but could fly 48 miles in a day.

**Terrain:** Does not affect air travel.

#### Flying Mounts

In general, a winged beast may carry riders or other burdens based on its HD:

* **3 HD creatures:** May carry a being about half the size of an adult human.
* **6 HD creatures:** May carry an adult human.
* **12 HD creatures:** May carry a large animal like a horse.
* **24 HD creatures:** May carry a very large animal like an elephant.

### Foraging

Foraging for herbs, fruits, nuts, etc. can be performed alongside normal movement (see **#Overland Travel**). The party has a 1-in-6 chance per day of finding enough food for 1d6 human-sized beings.

### Hunting

Hunting animals takes up a complete day, with no travelling or resting possible. When hunting, there is a 1-in-6 chance of encountering animals which may be suitable for eating (if they can be caught!). This is in addition to the normal chance of random encounters (see **#Wandering Monsters**).

### Losing Direction

At the start of each day of travel, the referee should roll to determine if the group loses direction. The probability depends on the terrain being traversed:

* **Clear, grasslands:** 1-in-6.
* **Barren lands, hills, mountains, woods:** 2-in-6.
* **Desert, jungle, swamp:** 3-in-6.

**Effects:** See **Losing Direction**.

### Overland Travel

**Miles per day:** The number of miles a character can travel in a day is **determined by dividing their base movement rate by five**. For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could travel up to 24 miles in a day.

#### Terrain Modifiers

Some types of terrain modify the speed at which characters can travel:

* **Broken lands, desert, forest, hills:** 33% slower.
* **Jungle, mountains, swamp:** 50% slower.
* **Maintained roads:** 50% faster.

#### Forced March

If characters need to travel further in a day, they may engage in a forced march.

**Speed increase:** The distance travelled is increased by 50%. For example, a character that can normally travel 24 miles in a day could travel 36 miles.

**Rest:** After a forced march, characters must rest for a full day.

### Resting

**Frequency of rest:** Characters must rest for one day per six days of travel.

**Penalty for not resting:** If characters press on without resting, they suffer a penalty of -1 to hit and damage rolls until they have rested for one full day.

### Surprise

**Surrounded:** If a party is surprised by three or more monsters, the monsters may have moved to encircle the party.

### Visibility

Characters can usually see for three miles around them, in open terrain. This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g. in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g. looking out from the top of a mountain).

### Wandering Monsters

**Frequency:** A check is typically rolled once per day, but the referee may choose to make more checks: up to three or four per day.

**Chance:** The chance of encountering a wandering monster depends on the terrain being explored (see below).

**Distance:** Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either side is surprised (see **Encounters**), this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.

#### Chance by Terrain

* **City, clear, grasslands, settled lands:** 1-in-6.
* **Aerial, barren, desert, forest, hills:** 2-in-6.
* **Jungle, mountains, swamp:** 3-in-6.

## Waterborne Adventuring

### Sequence of Play Per Day

* **Decide course:** The players decide on their course of travel for the day.
* **Losing direction:** The referee determines whether the party gets lost.
* **Weather:** The referee determines the **#Wind Conditions**.
* **Wandering monsters:** The referee makes checks as applicable.
* **Description:** The referee describes the regions passed through and any sites of interest that the party comes across, asking players for their actions, as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in **Encounters**.
* **End of day:** The referee updates time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the crew’s need to rest.

### Distance and Measurement

**Ranges and movement rates:** Are measured in yards, instead of feet. This means that ranges and movement rates are tripled.

**Areas:** Of spell effects, breath weapons, etc. are still measured in feet.

### Losing Direction

**With a navigator aboard:** The chance of getting lost is 2-in-6.

**Without a navigator aboard:** The chance of getting lost is 100% on the open seas and 2-in-6 within sight of land.

**Effects:** See **Losing Direction**.

### Surprise

Aquatic monsters are usually not surprised by ships. Special circumstances (e.g. thick fog) may alter this.

### Travel on the Water

**Miles per day:** The number of miles a creature or vessel can travel in a day is determined by **dividing its base movement rate by five**. For example, a vessel with a base movement rate of 360’ could travel up to 72 miles in a day.

#### Modifiers

The distance travelled in a day may be affected by the prevailing water and weather conditions:

* **River travel:** Water currents may increase (when moving downstream) or decrease (when moving upstream) the distance travelled by 1d6+6 miles per day.
* **Sailing:** The movement rate of sailing vessels is affected by the prevailing wind conditions. See **#Wind Conditions**.

### Visibility

**Land:** On a clear day, land can be spotted at a distance of 24 miles. This may be reduced based on light and weather conditions.

**Ships:** May be sighted and identified at 300 yards on a clear day or as little as 40 yards in dense fog.

### Wandering Monsters

**Frequency:** A check is typically rolled once per day, but the referee may choose to make more checks: up to 3 or 4 a day.

**Chance:** The chance of encountering a wandering monster is 2-in-6 on oceans or rivers, 3-in-6 in swamps.

**Distance:** Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either side is surprised (see **Encounters**), this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.

**Location:** Aquatic encounters may occur either on the open water or on land, if the party docks at some point during the day.

### Wind Conditions

Wind conditions at sea affect the rate at which a sailing vessel can travel. Extreme winds can also make travel hazardous. At the start of each day, the referee should roll 2d6 to determine wind conditions:

* **2:** No wind; sailing is not possible.
* **3–11:** Normal sailing is possible.
* **12:** Gale or storm; sailing vessels’ speed tripled (see **#Gales and Storms**).

#### Variable Wind Conditions (Optional Rule)

Groups who prefer a slightly more detailed system of sea travel may use the table below, which adds extra detail to the daily 2d6 wind conditions roll.

| 2d6 | Wind          | Effect                                                                 |
|-----|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2   | No wind       | Sailing impossible. Movement by oar at 1/3 rate (due to fatigue).      |
| 3   | Faint breeze  | Sailing movement rate reduced to 1/3 normal.                           |
| 4   | Gentle breeze | Sailing movement rate reduced to 1/2 normal.                           |
| 5   | Moderate breeze | Sailing movement rate reduced to 2/3 normal.                         |
| 6–8 | Fresh breeze  | Normal sailing movement rate.                                          |
| 9   | Strong breeze | Sailing movement rate increased by 1/3.                                |
| 10  | High wind     | Sailing movement rate increased by 1/2.                                |
| 11  | Near gale     | Sailing movement rate doubled. See **Near Gales**.                     |
| 12  | Gale or storm | Sailing movement rate tripled. See **Gales and Storms**.               |

#### Near Gales

**Seaworthy vessels:** Have a 10% chance of taking on water.

**Unseaworthy vessels:** Have a 20% chance of taking on water.

**Effect of taking on water:** The ship’s movement rare is reduced by one third until repaired at a dock.

#### Gales and Storms

**Seaworthy vessels:** Sailing vessels are swept along with the wind, as follows:

* The vessel travels at three times its normal speed in a randomly determined direction. (The referee may roll 1d6, with 1 indicating the intended direction of travel, 2 indicating 60{{deg}} to the right, 3 indicating 120{{deg}} to the right, and so on.)
* If the random course of travel causes the ship to reach land, there is a 75% chance of it wrecking against the shore. Otherwise, the ship finds shelter.

**Unseaworthy vessels:**

* If the vessel is in sight of land when the gale hits, it may attempt to beach. If the shore is clear terrain, this is automatically successful; for other terrain types there is a 2-in-6 chance of finding a safe harbour to weather the storm.
* Otherwise, the vessel is 80% likely to be swamped and sink.

## Encounters

An encounter begins when characters meet a monster, either due to there being a planned encounter in the area being explored or because a wandering monster check (see **Wandering Monsters**) indicates an encounter.

### Encounter Sequence

* **Surprise:** The referee rolls for surprise, if applicable.
* **Encounter distance:** The referee determines how far away the monsters are from the PCs.
* **Initiative:** Any sides that are not surprised roll initiative to determine who acts first.
* **Actions:** Any sides that are not surprised decide how they will respond to the encounter. The encounter is played out accordingly.
* **Conclusion:** One turn has passed.

### Surprise

#### When to Check

A check for surprise is made for any side that is not expecting the encounter. For example, if a monster has spotted an approaching party’s torch light and is waiting quietly, the monster would not need to roll surprise, but the party would.

#### Light and Surprise

Characters or monsters that carry a light in a dark environment are usually unable to surprise opponents, because the light gives their presence away.

#### Surprise Checks

Each side that is not already aware of the other’s presence rolls 1d6.

**Monsters:** The referee rolls for monsters.

**PCs:** One player rolls for the adventuring party as a whole.

**Results:** A result of 1 or 2 means the side is surprised.

#### Effects of Surprise

**Both sides surprised:** There is simply a momentary confusion—neither side has any advantage.

**One side surprised:** The side that is not surprised gains a one round advantage. The surprised side cannot act that round.

### Encounter Distance

The situation in which the encounter occurs often determines how far away the monster is. If there is uncertainty, the encounter distance may be determined randomly:

* **Dungeon:** 2d6 × 10 feet.
* **Wilderness:** 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 × 10 yards if either side is surprised).
* **Waterborne:** 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 × 10 yards if either side is surprised).

### Initiative

(See **Combat** for full details.)

**Roll 1d6:** For each side, at the start of each round.

**Winner:** The side with the highest roll acts first, followed by other sides in order from highest to lowest initiative.

**Ties:** Either both sides may roll again, or actions on both sides may be resolved simultaneously.

### Actions

#### Player Character Actions

The players decide how they will act.

#### Monster Actions

The referee determines monsters’ reaction to the party. Sometimes, circumstances make it obvious how a monster will react. Otherwise, the referee may roll on the table below to determine how a monster reacts to the party.

**Charisma:** If one specific character attempts to speak with the monsters, that character’s NPC reactions modifier due to CHA (see **Ability Scores**) is used to modify the monster reaction roll.


| 2d6       | Result                  |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| 2 or less | Attacks                 |
| 3–5       | Hostile, may attack     |
| 6–8       | Uncertain, confused     |
| 9–11      | Indifferent, may negotiate |
| 12 or more| Eager, friendly         |

#### Common Actions

Any action is possible in an encounter, but the following are common:

* **Combat:** If one side attacks, casts spells, or makes tactical movement, begin tracking time in rounds, following the combat procedure (see **Combat**).
* **Evasion:** If one side decides to flee, the other may decide to pursue. See **#Evasion**.
* **Parley:** PCs may attempt to communicate with monsters. Opening an encounter in this way can influence the monsters’ behaviour (see **#Monster Actions**). If both sides decide to talk, the negotiation may be role-played.

### Movement

**Encounter movement rate:** During encounters, a character can move up to one third of their base movement rate per round in feet (in the dungeon) or yards (in the wilderness). For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could move 40’ per round during a dungeon encounter.

**Maximum duration:** Characters may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds (one turn).

### Evasion

If one side wishes to avoid an encounter, it may attempt to flee. This is called **evasion** and is only possible **before combat has begun**. When a side decides to attempt an evasion, the opposing side must decide whether or not to pursue.

**Players:** May decide freely whether they wish to pursue fleeing monsters.

**Monsters:** The referee must decide whether monsters pursue fleeing PCs. (A low roll on the Monster Reactions table may be taken to indicate that the monster will pursue.)

**No pursuit:** If the opposing side decides to let the other side flee, then the evasion automatically succeeds; the encounter is avoided.

**Pursuit:** If the opposing side gives chase, the chance of the evasion succeeding depends on the environment being explored. See **Evasion and Pursuit**.

### Conclusion

An encounter is assumed to take at least one full turn to complete, including time to rest, regroup, clean weapons, bind wounds, and so on, afterwards.

## Evasion and Pursuit

### In the Dungeon

#### Evasion

Compare the two sides’ movement rates:

* **Fleeing side faster:** The evasion automatically succeeds, unless the fleeing side is forced to stop.
* **Fleeing side not faster:** A pursuit occurs.

#### Pursuit

**Time:** Is measured in rounds (see **Time, Weight, Movement**).

**Running:** Each side is assumed to be running at full speed (see below).

**Line of sight:** Most monsters will stop pursuing if they lose sight of characters.

**Dropping treasure:** Intelligent monsters have a 3-in-6 chance of stopping pursuit to pick up treasure dropped by fleeing characters.

**Dropping food:** Unintelligent monsters have a 3-in-6 chance of stopping pursuit to eat food dropped by fleeing characters.

**Obstacles:** Burning oil or other obstacles may also slow or stop a pursuit.

#### Running

**Movement rate:** During a pursuit, characters run at their full movement rate in feet per round.

**Mapping:** Is not possible while running.

**Exhaustion:** Characters become exhausted after running for 30 rounds.

**Effects of exhaustion:** A -2 penalty to attacks, damage, and Armour Class.

**Resting:** The penalties for exhaustion last until characters have rested for three full turns.

### Waterborne

#### Evasion

The chance of evasion is determined by the difference between the two sides’ movement rates, listed in the table below.

**Success:** If the evasion roll succeeds, the pursuers lose sight of the fleeing side. They can only attempt to pursue again if they happen to encounter the fleeing side again the following day.

**Failure:** If the evasion roll fails, a pursuit occurs.

#### Waterborne Evasion Chance

| Fleeing Side’s Movement Rate (Compared with Pursuer’s) | Chance of Evasion |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Faster than pursuer                                    | 80%               |
| 0’–30’ per round slower than pursuer                   | 50%               |
| 31’–60’ per round slower than pursuer                  | 40%               |
| 61’–90’ per round slower than pursuer                  | 35%               |
| 91’–120’ per round slower than pursuer                 | 25%               |
| 121’+ per round slower than pursuer                    | 10%               |

#### Pursuit

**Time:** Is measured in rounds (see Time, Weight, Movement).

**Initial distance:** The two sides begin a pursuit at normal encounter distance (see Waterborne Adventuring).

**Closing in:** The distance between the two sides decreases by the difference between their two movement rates each round (a minimum of 30’ per round).

### In the Wilderness

#### Evasion

The chance of evasion is a percentile roll. If the percentile evasion roll fails, a pursuit occurs. Surprise (see **Encounters**) determines the chance of evasion:

* **No surprise:** If neither side is surprised, the chance of evasion is determined by the relative size of the two groups. (The chances are in favour of the smaller group, as larger groups cannot move as fast or as quietly.) The **Wilderness Evasion Base Chance** table indicates the base chance of evasion.
* **Surprised side:** May generally not evade. The referee may rule that environmental conditions give a small chance of evasion even when surprised (as above). For example, dense woodland may give a surprised side a 10% chance of evasion.
* **Surprising side:** If one side has surprised the other, the side with surprise may evade automatically—the surprised side is not even aware that the encounter occurred.

#### Wilderness Evasion Base Chance

| Fleeing Group Size | 1 Pursuer / Few | Medium Number of Pursuers | Many Pursuers |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 1–4               | 50% (1 pursuer) | 70% (2–3 pursuers)        | 90% (4+)      |
| 5–12              | 35% (1–3)       | 50% (4–8)                 | 70% (9+)      |
| 13–24             | 25% (1–6)       | 35% (7–16)                | 50% (17+)     |
| 25+               | 10% (1–10)      | 25% (11–30)               | 35% (31+)     |

#### Evasion Modifiers

**One side twice as fast:** If the pursuing side’s movement rate is double that of the other, the chance of evasion is decreased by 25%. If the fleeing side’s movement rate is double that of the other, the chance of evasion is increased by 25%.

**Environment:** The referee may modify the probabilities based on the conditions and environment. For example, in a densely wooded area, the chance of evasion may be increased by 25%.

**Minimum chance:** The chance of escape is always at least 5%.

#### Pursuit

The following procedure is followed, day by day, until the pursuit is over:

* The fleeing side moves in a random direction, determined by the referee (no mapping is possible).
* If the pursuing side’s movement rate is greater than that of the fleeing side, there is a 50% chance of it catching up. If the roll succeeds, the fleeing side has been caught; the pursuit is over. Otherwise, continue to step 3.
* The fleeing side must decide whether to continue fleeing. If it decides to continue, it may make another evasion attempt (see above). If the attempt to evade fails, return to step 1. If the fleeing group decides to stop fleeing, it is caught (the pursuit ends).

## Combat

### Combat Sequence Per Round

* **Declare spells and melee movement**
* **Initiative:** Each side rolls 1d6.
* **Winning side acts:**
    * **Monster morale**
    * **Movement**
    * **Missile attacks**
    * **Spell casting**
    * **Melee attacks**
* **Other sides act:** In initiative order.

### Declare Spells and Melee Movement

Players must inform the referee if they intend to **cast a spell** or **move when in melee**. Other actions need not be declared.

### Initiative

**Roll 1d6:** For each side at the start of each round.

**Winner:** The side with the highest roll acts first. Other sides act in order from highest to lowest roll.

**Ties:** Either both sides may roll again or actions on both sides may be resolved simultaneously. (This means that both sides may inflict deadly blows on each other!)

#### Slow Weapons

Combatants attacking with two-handed melee weapons (and some missile weapons—as indicated in the equipment description) always act last in the round, as if they had lost initiative.

#### Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)

Instead of an initiative roll per side, a roll may be made for each individual involved in a battle, modified by DEX (see **Ability Scores**). The referee may determine an initiative modifier for monsters that are very fast or slow, instead of applying a DEX modifier.

### Monster Morale (Optional Rule)

See **Morale (Optional Rule)**.

### Movement

#### Outside of Melee

**Movement rate:** Combatants can move up to their encounter movement rate each round.

**Maximum duration:** Combatants may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds.

#### In Melee

When in melee with a foe, only the following forms of movement are possible:

* **Fighting withdrawal:** The combatant moves backwards at up to half their encounter movement rate. There must be clear space behind the combatant.
* **Retreat:** The combatant turns and flees from melee, moving up to their full encounter movement rate. This round: the retreating combatant may not attack; the opponent gains a +2 bonus to all attacks against the retreating combatant and ignores any AC bonus due to the combatant’s shield (if applicable).

### Missile Attacks

Are possible when opponents are more than 5’ from one another. See **Attacking**.

#### Range Modifiers

All missile weapons have ranges, noted in the equipment lists.

**Short range:** +1 bonus to attack rolls.

**Medium range:** No bonuses or penalties.

**Long range:** -1 penalty to attack rolls.

**Beyond long range:** Attack not possible.

#### Targets Behind Cover

**Complete cover:** The target cannot be hit.

**Partial cover:** The referee may apply attack penalties of between -1 and -4 (e.g. a small table might incur a -1 penalty; dense woods might incur a -4 penalty).

### Spell Casting

**Freedom:** The spell caster must be able to speak and move their hands. A spell caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.

**Sole action:** When casting a spell, no other actions may be taken in the round.

**No movement:** The spell caster cannot move and cast a spell in the same round.

**Line of sight:** Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a specific monster, character, object, or area of effect) must be visible to the caster.

#### Disrupting Spells

If a spell caster loses initiative and is successfully attacked or fails a saving throw before their turn, the spell being cast is disrupted and fails. It is removed from the caster’s memory as if it had been cast.

### Melee Attacks

Are possible when opponents are 5’ or less from each other. See **Attacking**.

### Other Sides Act

Repeat steps 3.1 to 3.5 for each side, in order of initiative (highest first).

### Attacking

#### Attack Rolls

* **Roll 1d20**
* **Apply modifiers:** STR for melee; DEX, range, cover for missile attacks.
* **Determine hit AC:** Look up the result in the attack matrix row for the attacker’s THAC0 (see **Combat Tables**). This column the AC score that the attack hits.
* **Result:** If the hit AC is equal to or lower than the opponent’s AC, the attack hits. Referee rolls for damage.

#### Ascending Armour Class (Optional Rule)

Groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC (see **Game Statistics**) should use the following attack procedure instead.

* **Roll 1d20**
* **Apply modifiers:** STR for melee; DEX, range, cover for missile attacks.
* **Determine hit AC:** Add the attackers’s attack bonus to the attack roll. The result is the ascending AC score that the attack hits.
* **Result:** If the hit AAC is equal to or higher than the opponent’s AAC, the attack hits. Referee rolls for damage.

#### 1s and 20s

Natural 20 attack rolls always hit. Natural 1 attack rolls always miss.

#### Invulnerabilities

Some monsters are immune to certain attacks. In this case, even if an attack hits, damage is not rolled.

#### Attacks Per Round

PCs normally attack once per round. Some monsters have multiple attacks.

#### Attacking and Moving

Movement and attacking may be combined in the same round.

#### Rolling for Damage

**PC attacks:** Inflict 1d6 damage. Damage of melee attacks is modified by STR.

**Monster attacks:** Deal the damage indicated in the monster’s description.

**Minimum damage:** An attack which hits always deals at least one point of damage, even when damage modifiers reduce the number rolled to 0 or less.

**Death:** A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.

#### Variable Weapon Damage (Optional Rule)

Some groups may prefer different weapons to inflict different amounts of damage. In this case, PC attacks inflict the damage indicated for the weapon in the equipment lists.

## Other Combat Issues

### Attacking from Behind

AC bonuses from shields are negated.

### Blindness

A blind character is unable to attack.

### Bombing

Flying creatures may pick up rocks or other objects and drop them from above.

**Altitude:** At most 300’.

**Chance to hit:** 16 or higher on 1d20.

**Affected area and damage:** Depend on the size of the bomb—larger creatures can carry larger bombs. For example, a bomb from a flying creature able to carry a human might inflict 2d6 damage to all creatures hit in a 10’ × 10’ area.

### Invulnerabilities (Optional Rule)

Some monsters can only be harmed by magical or silver weapons. The referee may allow such monsters to also be harmed by attacks from:

* Another invulnerable monster.
* A monster with 5 HD or greater.

### Paralysed Opponents

Helpless opponents, such as those magically paralysed or frozen, can be automatically hit in melee. Only a roll for damage is required.

### Spacing

The referee should judge the number of opponents that can attack a single combatant, bearing in mind the combatant’s size and the available space around them.

**10’ passage:** Enough space for at most 2–3 characters to fight side-by-side.

### Subduing (Optional Rule)

Characters that wish to subdue an intelligent opponent may declare the intent to attack without killing.

**Blunt blows:** Only bludgeoning attacks may be made. Bladed melee weapons can deal blunt blows by attacking with the flat of the blade.

**Subdual damage:** Attack and damage rolls are handled normally, but subdual damage is noted separately from actual damage.

**Effect at 0hp:** An intelligent character or monster reduced to 0 hit points due to subdual damage will surrender, realising that its opponent could have killed it.

### Unarmed Attacks

**Attack rolls:** Unarmed combat is handled the same as melee combat.

**Damage:** Unarmed attacks inflict 1d2 damage, modified by STR.

### Unstable Surfaces

Characters on an unstable surface, such as a ship in rough seas or riding a flying animal, are affected as follows:

* **Missile attacks:** Suffer a -4 penalty.
* **Spells:** Cannot be cast.
* **Magic items:** Can be used normally.

Note that magical means of flight (e.g. a broom of flying, flying carpet, *fly* spell) generally do not count as unstable.

### Water

When fighting in or beneath water:

* **Penalties:** Attack and damage rolls should be penalised.
* **Missile weapons:** Usually do not work at all underwater.

## Morale (Optional Rule)

In combat, the referee decides whether monsters or NPCs surrender or run away. The following system may be utilised.

### Morale Rating

Monsters are rated for morale with a number from 2–12. This represents their courage in battle. Higher morale scores indicate more fearless monsters.

**A score of 2:** Means the monster will not fight. No morale checks should be made.

**A score of 12:** Means the monster fights to the death, never checking morale.

### Morale Checks

The referee rolls 2d6 and compares the result against the monster’s morale score:

* **Higher than morale score:** The monster will surrender or attempt to flee.
* **Equal to or lower than morale score:** The monster will continue to fight.

**Two successes:** If a monster makes two successful morale checks in an encounter, it will fight until killed, with no further checks necessary.

### When to Check Morale

Monsters make morale checks (rolled by the referee) in two circumstances:

**First death on side:** The first time one of their number is killed in battle.

**Side half incapacitated:** When half the monsters are incapacitated (slain, paralysed, etc).

### Situational Adjustments

The referee may apply morale modifiers from –2 to +2, based on the situation. For example, the side losing a battle might suffer a –1 morale penalty, while the side winning may gain a +1 bonus.

**Scores of 2 or 12:** Adjustments are never applied to monsters with a morale of 2 or 12.

### Mercenary Morale

Mercenaries (see **Mercenaries**) have a morale rating and check morale in exactly the same way as monsters.

**Morale rating:** Determined solely by the type of troops, see below. The CHA of the hiring character has no influence.

**Modifiers:** The referee may penalise mercenaries’ morale in poor conditions (e.g. low wages, abuse, frequent death) or raise it in good conditions (e.g. riches, glory in battle).

#### Mercenary Morale

| Troop Type           | Morale |
|----------------------|--------|
| Untrained, militia   | 6      |
| Barbarian horde      | 7      |
| Trained warriors     | 8      |
| Mounted              | +1     |
| Elite troops         | +1     |
| Fanatics, berserkers | +2     |

### Retainer Morale

Retainers signed up to work as adventurers, so are not frightened off at the first sign of danger. Retainers do not make morale checks in combat, but a loyalty check may be required in extreme peril (see **Retainers**).

## Combat Tables

These tables list the attack probabilities for all monsters and characters and the saving throw values used by monsters and normal humans.

### Normal Humans

All humans who are not a member of an adventuring class are classified as **normal humans**. They are treated as having less than 1 Hit Die and have their own saving throw and attack probabilities (the table rows labelled NH).

### Example of Making an Attack Roll

A 5th level fighter attacks a monster with AC 4. The attack is resolved as follows:

* The player rolls 1d20. The roll comes up 14.
* The fighter has a STR score of 13, meaning they gain a +1 bonus to melee attack rolls. The result of the attack roll is thus 15.
* A 5th level fighter has a THAC0 score of 17 [+2] (listed in the class description), so the player refers to that row of the attack matrix.
* The player looks up the result (15) in the THAC0 17 [+2] attack matrix row. 15 is in the AC 2 column, indicating that the attack hits AC 2.
* As AC 2 is better than the monster’s Armour Class (4), the attack hits!
* Damage is rolled and the result subtracted from the monster’s current hit point total.

### Attack Rolls Using THAC0 (Optional Rule)

Instead of referring to the attack matrix, attacks may be resolved using THAC0 directly. A THAC0 score denotes the attack roll required to hit AC 0. The attack roll required to hit opponents of other AC scores can be calculated by subtracting the target AC from the THAC0. For example, a character with a THAC0 of 19 could hit an opponent with AC 5 on a roll of 14 or greater (19 - 5 = 14).

**Note:** Using THAC0 to resolve attack rolls results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of referring to the attack matrix.

#### Attack Matrix

| Monster HD   | THAC0     | -3 | -2 | -1 |  0  |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 |
|--------------|-----------|----|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| NH           | 20  [-1]  | 20 | 20 | 20 | **20** | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 |
| Up to 1      | 19  [0]   | 20 | 20 | 20 | **19** | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 |
| 1+ to 2      | 18  [+1]  | 20 | 20 | 19 | **18** | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 |  9 |
| 2+ to 3      | 17  [+2]  | 20 | 19 | 18 | **17** | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 |  9 |  8 |
| 3+ to 4      | 16  [+3]  | 19 | 18 | 17 | **16** | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 |  9 |  8 |  7 |
| 4+ to 5      | 15  [+4]  | 18 | 17 | 16 | **15** | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 |  9 |  8 |  7 |  6 |
| 5+ to 6      | 14  [+5]  | 17 | 16 | 15 | **14** | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 |  9 |  8 |  7 |  6 |  5 |
| 6+ to 7      | 13  [+6]  | 16 | 15 | 14 | **13** | 12 | 11 | 10 |  9 |  8 |  7 |  6 |  5 |  4 |
| 7+ to 9      | 12  [+7]  | 15 | 14 | 13 | **12** | 11 | 10 |  9 |  8 |  7 |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |
| 9+ to 11     | 11  [+8]  | 14 | 13 | 12 | **11** | 10 |  9 |  8 |  7 |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |
| 11+ to 13    | 10  [+9]  | 13 | 12 | 11 | **10** |  9 |  8 |  7 |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  2 |
| 13+ to 15    |  9 [+10]  | 12 | 11 | 10 |  **9** |  8 |  7 |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  2 |  2 |
| 15+ to 17    |  8 [+11]  | 11 | 10 |  9 |  **8** |  7 |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |
| 17+ to 19    |  7 [+12]  | 10 |  9 |  8 |  **7** |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |
| 19+ to 21    |  6 [+13]  |  9 |  8 |  7 |  **6** |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |
| 21+ or more  |  5 [+14]  |  8 |  7 |  6 |  **5** |  4 |  3 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |

**Monsters:** Use the attack matrix row for their Hit Dice (see monster description).

**Monsters with bonus hit points:** Monsters whose Hit Dice are notated as a number of dice plus a fixed hit point bonus (e.g. HD 2+1 — see **Hit point modifiers** under **Game Statistics (Monsters)**) are more powerful and attack as if they were 1 HD higher. For example, a monster with 2 HD uses the THAC0 18 [+1] row, but a monster with 2+1 HD uses the THAC0 17 [+2] row.

**Characters:** Use the attack matrix row for their THAC0 score (see class description).

**Normal humans:** Use the attack matrix row labelled NH.

#### Monster Saving Throws

| Hit Dice     | Death | Wands | Paralysis | Breath | Spells |
|--------------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| NH           | 14    | 15    | 16        | 17     | 18     |
| 1–3          | 12    | 13    | 14        | 15     | 16     |
| 4–6          | 10    | 11    | 12        | 13     | 14     |

| 22 or more   |  2    |  2    |  2        |  2     |  2     |

**Monsters:** Use the saving throw table row noted in the monster description.

**Characters:** Do not use this table. See the saving throw table in the class description.

**Normal humans:** Use the saving throw table row labelled NH.
