# Equipment & Services

## Weath

Successful characters accumulate wealth from the spoils of their adventures. Treasure may take many forms, but often the most useful form of treasure is money.

### Money

Gold pieces (gp) are the most common currency. Coins made of other metals—platinum (pp), electrum (ep), silver (sp), and copper (cp)—are also used. The conversion rates of coins are shown below.

#### Coin Conversion Rates

|              | 1 pp | 1 gp | 1 ep | 1 sp | 1 cp |
|--------------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **Value in pp** | 1    | 1/5  | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/500 |
| **Value in gp** | 5    | 1    | 1/2  | 1/10 | 1/100 |
| **Value in ep** | 10   | 2    | 1    | 1/5  | 1/50  |
| **Value in sp** | 50   | 10   | 5    | 1    | 1/10  |
| **Value in cp** | 500  | 100  | 50   | 10   | 1     |

### Starting Money

PCs begin play with 3d6 × 10 gold pieces.

### Inheritance

Faced with the possibility of character death, players may wish to create a will for their characters, to leave wealth behind for an heir. If the referee allows this, the following stipulations apply:

* **Tax:** Any treasure left as an inheritance will be taxed at 10%.
* **Heir:** The heir must be a newly created character of 1st level.
* **Once only:** Inheritance may only be left once by each player.

### Domains

When characters have amassed sufficient wealth, they will often wish to construct a base or stronghold and possibly found a domain.

See **Strongholds** for full rules on building a stronghold and founding a domain.

**Holy symbol:** Divine spell casters must carry a holy symbol of their deity, often in the form of a pendant around the neck. Each deity has their own holy symbol.

**Holy water:** Water blessed by a holy person, stored in a special vial for use in religious rituals. Holy water inflicts damage on undead monsters (see **Weapon Combat Stats**). Loses its power if transferred from the blessed vials it is stored in.

**Iron spikes:** May be used for wedging doors open or shut (see **Dungeon Adventuring**), as an anchor to attach a rope to, and many other purposes.

**Lantern:** Shutters allow the light to be hidden and the flame protected. Burns one oil flask every four hours (24 turns). Casts light in a 30’ radius.

**Mirror:** Useful for looking around corners or for reflecting a gaze attack.

**Oil flask:** A flask of oil fuels a lantern for four hours (24 turns). Burning oil can also be used as a weapon:

* **Throwing:** See **Weapons And Armour**.
* **Pools:** A flask of oil is sufficient for a 3’ diameter pool. If lit, it burns for 1 turn. Creatures passing through the flames suffer 1d8 damage.
* **Immunity:** Monsters that have a fire attack (e.g. flaming breath) are not harmed by burning oil.
* **Lighting:** Oil only causes damage if set on fire (e.g. touched with a burning torch).

**Pole, 10’:** A 2” thick wooden pole useful for poking and prodding suspicious items in a dungeon.

**Rations, iron:** Preserved food for long journeys.

**Rations, standard:** Fresh, unpreserved food.

**Rope:** Strong enough to hold the weight of three people and their equipment.

**Sack, large:** Can hold up to 600 coins.

**Sack, small:** Can hold up to 200 coins.

**Stakes and mallet:** A wooden mallet and three 18” long stakes. Valuable when confronting vampires.

**Thieves’ tools:** A set of lock picking tools in a small case.

**Tinder box:** Flint, steel, and tinder contained in a small box. Used to light fires, including torches. Using a tinder box takes one round. There is a 2-in-6 chance of success per round.

**Waterskin:** A leather container that holds up to 2 pints (1 quart) of liquid.

**Wolfsbane:** This flowering herb can be used to repel lycanthropes. The creature must be hit with the herb in melee combat.

### Other Equipment

The items detailed in this section are those most commonly available for purchase. Should PCs wish to purchase items not on these lists, the referee may use the listed items as guidelines for determining the prices and characteristics of new items, including combat statistics (if appropriate).

### Packing Bags

## Rules for Vehicles

### Game Statistics

#### Hull Points (hp)

The vehicle’s structural integrity and ability to keep moving when damaged. Analogous to a character’s hit points. A vehicle that reaches 0 hull points is destroyed.

#### Armour Class (AC)

The vehicle’s ability to resist damage from attacks.

#### Movement Rate

The speed at which the vehicle can move. Every vehicle has a **'base movement rate**' and an **'encounter movement rate**' (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one third of the base movement rate.

#### Cargo Capacity

The maximum load the vehicle can carry, measured in coins (see **Time, Weight, Movement**).

#### Required Crew

The number of people or animals (e.g. sailors, oarsmen, horses) required for the vehicle’s normal operation.

#### Passengers or Mercenaries

Some vehicles have extra space aboard specifically intended to carry passengers or mercenaries (of any type, see **Mercenaries**) in addition to the normal crew.  If a vehicle’s description does not mention this space for passengers, it is assumed to only have space for the crew—the referee may rule that cargo hold space could be converted into additional living quarters.

#### Seaworthiness

Water vessels are divided into two categories, each behaving differently under different wind conditions (see **Wind Conditions**).
Seaworthy vessels are suitable for use on the high seas, away from coastal waters. Unseaworthy vessels are restricted to rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.

### Damaging Vehicles

In combat, attacks and spells may directly target vehicles, as well as monsters or characters.

**Normal attacks:** Unless noted in a vehicle’s description, attacks with normal weapons (e.g. bows, swords, etc.) do not inflict hull damage.

**Magical attacks:** Damaging spells or magical attacks inflict one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.

**Giant monsters:** Can damage vehicles, inflicting one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.

**Mounted weaponry:** Some vehicles carry mounted weaponry specifically designed for vehicle-to-vehicle combat. Such weapons inflict hull damage directly. The rules for attacking with ship-mounted weapons are described in **Water Vessels**.

### Effects of Hull Damage

When a vehicle loses hull points, the damage causes a reduction in its movement rate. In the case of water vessels, this may be due to water seeping into the hull.

**Movement rate reduction:** For every 10% a vehicle is reduced from its maximum hull points, its movement rate is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, a vehicle that has lost 20% of its hull points has its movement rate reduced by 20%.

#### Destruction

If a vehicle is reduced to 0 hull points:

* It will lose its structural integrity in 1d10 rounds (e.g. a water vessel sinks).
* Any mounted weaponry is no longer functional.

#### Repairs

**In a workshop:** Vehicle damage can be repaired by experienced technicians working in a suitable workshop or dock.

**In the field:** A vehicle’s crew can repair up to half of any damage sustained. Remaining damage can only be repaired in a suitable workshop or dock.

**Time:** Five crew-members can repair 1 hull point of damage in one turn. This is a dedicated task, so crew-members cannot perform any other actions while engaged in repairs.

### Boarding

When the occupants of a vehicle wish to board another vehicle, the two vehicles must be brought alongside one another.

**Grappling**: If both vehicles are moving, they must be lashed together with grappling hooks before occupants of one may board the other. Grappling has a 2-in-6 chance of success per round in which the vehicles are adjacent.

**Mutual boarding intent**: If crew on both vehicles wish to grapple and board each other, the grappling attempt is automatically successful.

**Boarding**: Once two vehicles are grappled, characters may move between them freely. During the round in which a character moves between vehicles, they suffer a –2 penalty to attack rolls and AC.

### Rowed Water Vessels

#### Rowing Encounter Speeds

Some rowed vessels may have an increased encounter movement rate. This represents the great effort on the part of the oarsmen that may be exerted during combat. Such speeds cannot be maintained for long periods, thus the per turn and per day movement rates of such vessels are much slower.

#### Reduced Oarsmen

Having less than the required number of oarsmen reduces a vessel’s speed.

**Movement rate reduction:** For every 10% reduction in the available rowing crew, the vessel’s rowing speed is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if 10% of a vessel’s oarsmen are occupied repairing hull damage, the vessel moves at 90% of its normal speed (i.e. 10% slower than normal).

## Land Vehicles

**Cart:** A two-wheeled vehicle. Carts have an AC of 9 [10] and 1d4 hull points.

**Wagon:** A four-wheeled vehicle. Wagons have an AC of 9 [10] and 2d4 hull points.

### Required Animals

These vehicles must be pulled by a minimum number of mules or draft horses. If double the minimum number of animals is employed, additional loads may be carried.

### Difficult Terrain

When travelling through difficult terrain (e.g. desert, forest, mountains, swamp), these vehicles can only travel on maintained roads.

## Water Vessels

### Vessel Dimensions

A ship’s **beam** is its width and its **draft** is the depth it extends beneath the water.

### Historical Periods

The vessels described in this section span various historical periods, from the ancient period to the medieval. Not all types of vessels may be available in a campaign setting.

#### Descriptions

**Lifeboat:** A small boat with a mast that collapses down for storage. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the cargo capacity of the ship on which it is carried by this much. 1–2 lifeboats are usually purchased for small ships, 3–4 for larger ships. A lifeboat is usually stocked with a week’s rations for ten human-sized characters.

**Longship:** A narrow ship which may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fill the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters, as needed.

**Sailing ship, large:** A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually has multiple decks and raised “castles” at the bow and stern, providing a good vantage point for archers.

**Sailing ship, small:** A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.

**Troop transport (large, small):** Vessels similar to normal sailing ships, but adapted for the mass transportation of troops and mounts. Often include large hatches allowing horses to board.

**Warship (large, small):** Vessels similar to normal sailing ships, but adapted for warfare, with space for mercenaries and catapults.

#### Descriptions

**Boat, river:** Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. A roof can be added to protect passengers and cargo, costing an additional 1,000gp.

**Boat, sailing:** A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.

**Canoe:** A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).

**Galley, large:** A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

**Galley, small:** A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

**Galley, war:** A large galley often specially constructed as a fleet’s flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10’–20’ wide wooden towers rising 15’–20’ above the bow and stern.

**Raft, makeshift:** Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1–3 days per 10’ square section (up to a maximum size of 20’ × 30’).

**Raft, professional:** A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some form of shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30’ × 40’. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).

\* Crew act as rowers, sailors, and fighters.

#### Ship Modifications

The following modifications may be made to an existing ship:

* **Warship:** A sailing ship may be converted into a warship or troop transport of the same size. The modification costs one-third of the ship’s original cost.
* **Catapult:** A catapult may be added to a galley, longship, or warship.
* **Ram:** A ram may be added to a large or small galley (a war galley already comes with a ram fitted).

### Ship Weaponry

| Item                 | Cost (gp) |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Catapult              | 100       |
| Catapult shot         | 5         |
| Catapult shot, pitch  | 25        |
| Ram, large galley     | 10,000    |
| Ram, small galley     | 3,000     |

#### Rams

Can be used against ships or giant sea monsters. Small individuals cannot be targeted.

**Attack rolls:** Are made using a THAC0 of 19 [0] and occur at the same point in the combat sequence as missile fire.

**Attack modifiers:** May be applied for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc.

**Large or war galley:** Deals 1d6+5 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 6d6 hit points damage against monsters.

**Small galley:** Deals 1d4+4 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 3d8 hit points damage against monsters.

#### Catapults

Fire either large rocks or flaming pitch.

**Weight:** A catapult plus twenty rounds of shot weighs 10,000 coins (subtracted from the ship’s cargo allowance).

**Range:** 150–300 yards.

**Attack rolls and rate of fire:** Depend on the number of crew manning the catapult:

* **2 crew (minimum):** Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 10 rounds.
* **3 crew:** Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 8 rounds.
* **4 crew (maximum):** Attacks with THAC0 17 [+2]. Fires every 5 rounds.

**Attack modifiers:** May be applied for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc.

##### Catapult Shot

Inflicts 3d6 hull damage against ships.

##### Catapult Shot, Pitch

Sets a 10’×10’ area of a ship on fire. The burning does 1d6 hull points of damage per turn (for at least one turn) and will spread to other areas of the ship if not extinguished. A fire may be put out by five crew in 3 turns, ten crew in 2 turns, or fifteen crew in 1 turn.

## Retainers

Retainers are NPCs hired to accompany a character on adventures.

**Limit per PC:** A character’s Charisma score defines the maximum number of retainers that will work for them at any one time (see **Ability Scores**).

**Duties:** Retainers are expected to share the risks of adventuring with the party, but will not continue working for a PC if treated poorly. A disgruntled retainer may spread word to others in the area, making it more difficult for the PC to hire other retainers.

### Class and Level

Retainers can be of any class (including normal humans—effectively of level 0), but must be of equal or lower level to the hiring PC.

### Recruitment

Potential retainers may be located by frequenting drinking establishments or by paying to post notices of help wanted.

Applicants are recruited through negotiation, with the referee playing the roles of the NPCs a character attempts to hire. The PC should explain what the job entails and the wages paid.

### Wages and Upkeep

The referee should determine the rate of pay desired by potential retainers, taking the following factors into account:

* **Skill level:** More experienced retainers will want a higher rate of pay, whereas those employed for unskilled tasks will have lower demands.
* **Competition:** Retainers may accept lower rates of pay if there are many applicants, but may demand higher rates if there is little competition for the job.

#### Standard Rate

Retainers will usually want a guaranteed fee (per day or per adventure) and a share of treasure recovered (at very least a half share). For example: a fee of 1gp per day plus a half share of treasure.

#### Upkeep

The hiring PC must also pay for the retainer’s daily upkeep (food and lodgings) and for any new adventuring gear, weapons, or mounts the retainer requires.

#### Shares of Treasure

Fractional shares of treasure are calculated by dividing the treasure by the total number of shares. For example, a party consisting of 5 PCs (who receive full shares) plus one retainer (who is paid a half share) discover 2,750gp of treasure. The total is divided by 5.5 (five full shares plus one half share): 500gp. Thus, each PC gains 500gp and the retainer gains 250gp.

### Applicant Reactions

Once an offer is made, the referee determines the potential retainer’s reaction by rolling 2d6 on the table below, modified as follows:

* **Charisma:** The roll is modified by the hiring character’s NPC reactions modifier due to CHA (see **Ability Scores**).
* **Generosity:** The referee may apply a bonus or penalty, depending on the attractiveness of the deal (+1 or +2 for generous offers, -1 or -2 for poor offers).
* **Reputation:** A penalty of -1 or -2 may be applied, if the hiring PC has a bad reputation.

#### Retainer Hiring Reactions

| 2d6        | Result                    |
|------------|---------------------------|
| 2 or less  | Ill will                  |
| 3–5        | Offer refused             |
| 6–8        | Roll again                |
| 9–11       | Offer accepted            |
| 12 or more | Offer accepted, +1 loyalty |

**Ill will:** The applicant’s ill will incurs a –1 penalty to further hiring reaction rolls made in the same settlement or area.

### Experience

Retainers gain experience and advance in level in the same way as PCs.

**XP penalty:** Because retainers are generally not directly involved in decision making, instead following instructions from PCs, XP they receive is penalised by –50%.

**Normal humans:** When a normal human (i.e. a retainer of level 0 with no character class) gains XP, they must choose an adventuring character class.

### Loyalty

A retainer’s loyalty rating reflects their willingness to stick by PCs in the face of danger. Loyalty is determined by the hiring character’s CHA (see **Ability Scores**), but may be adjusted as follows:

* **Bonuses:** Saving a retainer from danger or granting generous treasure rewards may increase loyalty.
* **Penalties:** Ill-treatment of a retainer or lack of treasure may decrease loyalty.

### Loyalty Checks

To make a loyalty check, the referee should roll 2d6 against the retainer’s loyalty. If the roll is lower than or equal to the retainer’s loyalty, the check succeeds.

### When to Check Loyalty

Loyalty checks are made in two circumstances:

* **Peril:** In situations of unexpectedly great danger. If the roll fails, the retainer will likely flee.
* **After an adventure:** If the roll fails, the retainer will not work for the PC again.

## Mercenaries

Soldiers-for-hire who are typically enlisted to defend a stronghold. They will perform other military duties in a wilderness setting, such as driving away monsters from surrounding lands, fighting other armies, and so on. Mercenaries will not accompany characters on adventures.

Note that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.

### Locating Mercenaries

Mercenaries can be located by posting notices. The response will depend on the availability of suitable troops in the area and the offer made.

### Wages

**Outside of wartime:** As listed below.

**During wartime:** All wages are doubled.

### Upkeep

The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear. Most mercenaries already have weapons and armour when hired, though their employer may give them additional gear. Note that armourers are required to repair mercenaries’ armour and weapons (see **Specialists**).

### Mercenaries

## Specialists

All types of characters that PCs may wish to hire for non-combat and non-adventuring purposes (i.e. not mercenaries or retainers) are termed **specialists**.

Note that as specialists are hired to perform non-adventuring services, they are not treated as retainers. Unlike retainers, there is no limit on the number of specialists a character may employ.

The most common types of specialists are described, along with their usual monthly wage. The referee may add new types of specialists as desired.

### Locating Specialists

Specialists can be located by posting notices or inquiring at suitable guilds. The response will depend on the availability of suitable specialists in the area and the offer made.

### Wages and Upkeep

The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear.

#### Specialists

| Specialist          | Wage per Month   |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Alchemist           | 1,000gp          |
| Animal trainer      | 500gp            |
| Armourer            | 100gp            |
| Assistant armourer  | 15gp             |
| Blacksmith          | 25gp             |

| Navigator           | 150gp            |
| Oarsman             | 2gp              |
| Sage                | 2,000gp          |
| Sailor              | 10gp             |
| Ship’s captain      | 250gp            |
| Spy                 | 500gp (or more)  |

#### Alchemist

**Recreating potions:** Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost (see **Magical Research**).

**Researching potions:** An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.

#### Animal Trainer

Trainers are required for exotic creatures or for larger numbers of common animals (e.g. dogs, horses, mules).

**Speciality:** Each animal trainer specialises in a single type of animal.

**Number of animals:** A trainer can work with up to 6 animals at a time.

**Time required:** The referee decides the time required to train an animal, depending on the difficulty of the training and the animal’s intelligence. Learning the first new behaviour or trick typically takes at least one month. Subsequent behaviours take at least 2 weeks each.

**Interruptions:** Training of all desired behaviours must occur back to back. If interrupted, the animal becomes unable to learn further behaviours.

#### Armourer

**Producing weapons and armour:** An armourer can produce 5 weapons, 3 shields, or 1 suit of armour per month.

**Maintaining mercenaries’ gear:** A dedicated armourer is required per 50 troops.

**Assistants:** An armourer’s output (either in terms of arms produced or troops maintained) may be doubled by hiring two **assistant armourers** and one **blacksmith**. If four assistants and two blacksmiths are hired, the armourer’s output may be quadrupled. An armourer cannot coordinate more assistants than this.

#### Assistant Armourer

Apprentices who may work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See **#Armourer**.

#### Blacksmith

Craftsmen trained in the art of forging metal. Blacksmiths may be hired to work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See **#Armourer**.

#### Engineer

Engineers are experts in the planning and management of construction projects, for example building strongholds (see **Construction**).

**Number required:** One engineer is needed per 100,000gp cost of the project.

**Specialty:** Certain races may have special expertise (e.g. a dwarf engineer may specialise in subterranean construction).

#### Navigator

Experts in navigating the high seas. A ship that travels beyond sight of land becomes lost if a navigator is not aboard. (See **Waterborne Adventuring**.)

#### Oarsman

Normal humans employed to power rowed ships. Not trained for combat.

#### Sage

Sages are very rare individuals who devote their lives to the study of obscure knowledge. A sage may be consulted to answer unusual questions.

**Time and cost:** The referee must judge the time and cost required to research the answer to a question.

**Chance of success:** There is never a 100% chance of success in finding an answer.

#### Sailor

Normal humans trained in the handling of sailing ships. Sailors can fight to defend their ship, typically being equipped with a sword, shield, and leather armour.

#### Ship’s Captain

A seasoned sailor, required to command a larger ship. A captain is familiar with the waters around the coasts they frequent.

#### Spy

A spy is hired to gather information about a person or group. The spy may be an outsider who tries to infiltrate or may be a traitor already connected with the person or group to be spied upon.

**Class:** Spies are often NPC thieves, but may be of any character class.

**Time:** The referee will determine the time required for the job.

**Chance of success:** The referee judges the chance of the mission succeeding, based on the circumstances.

**Reliability:** The referee may also secretly decide a chance of the spy betraying the character.

## Strongholds

### Construction

When PCs wish to construct strongholds or any other type of building, the following procedure should be used:

* **Permission:** If the land to be built on falls within the dominion of an existing ruler, permission must usually be sought. When building in uncharted wilderness, this is not required.
* **Clear land:** If the construction site is in the wilderness, all monsters in a 6-mile area must be killed or driven off. On a typical wilderness hex map with a scale of 6 miles per hex, this means all monster lairs in a single hex.
* **Design:** The player creates a plan for the stronghold and calculates the construction cost (see prices in **Structures**).
* **Review:** The referee should review and approve the player’s plans.
* **Hire engineers:** For every 100,000gp cost of the stronghold, the PC must hire one engineer (see **Specialists**).
* **Construction:** Once the land has been cleared and construction materials delivered, construction may commence. The stronghold’s total cost determines the time required to build it: one day of game time per 500gp.
* **Prepare for settlers:** If the PC wishes to found a dominion and attract settlers, a wider area around the stronghold should be cleared of dangers.

### Building in Towns

**Permission:** While local rulers may allow PCs to build in a town, it is unlikely that they will grant permission for the construction of castles or fortifications.

**Costs:** When building in an existing town or city, the proximity of materials and labour greatly reduce the costs.

* **Stone buildings:** Reduced by 60%.

* **Wooden buildings:** Reduced by 80%.

### Domain Management

### Maintaining Cleared Lands

To prevent monsters from returning to cleared lands, mercenaries may be hired to conduct patrols. Regular patrols can prevent monsters from reinhabiting the area up to 18 miles around the stronghold. In difficult terrain (e.g. jungle, swamp, mountains), a garrison must be stationed every 6 miles.

### Settlers

If the PC spends additional funds on improving a cleared area, settlers may be attracted to move in. For example, the character might commission the construction of inns, docks, mills, and so on. Advertising may also be necessary. The referee will determine the costs involved and how many settlers are attracted.

### Taxation

If settlers move into the PC’s domain, the character will receive an income of 10gp of taxes per year from each settler.

### Structures

#### Structure Prices

| Structure                  | Cost     |

### Descriptions

**Barbican:** Heavily fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall: two small towers, a gatehouse, and a drawbridge.

**Bastion:** Semi-circular tower built against a castle wall. 30’ base, 30’ high, walls 5’ thick.

**Civilian building, stone:** Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. Outer wall 120’ long (e.g. 30’×30’), walls 1–2’ thick.

**Civilian building, wood:** Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. Outer wall 120’ long (e.g. 30’×30’).

**Drawbridge:** Raisable wooden bridge crossing a moat. May be attached to a gatehouse. 10’ long.

**Gatehouse:** Fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall. Includes a portcullis. 30’×30’ base, 20’ high, walls 5’ thick.

**Keep:** Fortified, central building of a castle. 60’ square, 80’ high, walls 10’ thick.

**Moat:** Defensive ditch, often filled with water. 100’ long, 20’ wide, 10’ deep.

**Subterranean passage:** Typical 10’×10’×10’ dungeon passageway.

**Tower, large:** Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. 30’ base, 40’ high, walls 5’ thick.

**Tower, small:** Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. 20’ base, 30’ high, walls 5’ thick.

**Wall, castle:** Stone wall with battlements. 100’ long, 20’ high, 10’ thick.

### Non-Standard Dimensions

#### Bastions

Bastions of dimensions other than those listed may be constructed. Use the guidelines for towers, below, and divide by two.

#### Castle Walls

Higher castle walls may be constructed at increased cost. A 100’ length of 30’ high wall costs 7,500gp. Every additional 10’ of height beyond this (up to a maximum of 60’ high) costs 5,000gp.

#### Towers

Towers of dimensions other than those listed may be constructed. The cost is determined by the height of the tower and the diameter of its base (in feet).

* **Maximum height:** Twice the base diameter.
* **Up to the base diameter:** Each 10’ of height costs 200gp × the base diameter.
* **Above the base diameter:** Each 10’ of height costs 400gp × the base diameter.

##### Example Tower Cost Calculation

A 60’ high tower with a 40’ diameter base is to be constructed.

The cost will be 8,000gp (40 × 200gp) per 10’ for the first 40’ of height and 16,000gp (40 × 400gp) per 10’ for the remainder of the height.

The total cost is thus (8,000gp × 4) + (16,000gp × 2) = 64,000gp.

### Interior Features

The common interior features of a stronghold are listed in the table below.

#### Simple Approach

For simplicity, the cost of a stronghold may be increased by 25% to account for interior details, including: reinforced doors, stone stairs, flagstone flooring, tile roofing, windows or arrow slits, bars and shutters on windows, and standard furnishings.

#### Detailed Approach

If the group wishes to perform more detailed calculations or if additional features are desired, the table below may be consulted.
