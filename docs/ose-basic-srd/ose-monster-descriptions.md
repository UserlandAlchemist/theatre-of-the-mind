### Dragon

A proud, ancient race of gigantic, carnivorous, winged reptiles. There are many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs, far from areas of human civilisation.

* **Behaviour:** Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.
* **Pride:** Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen to flattery.
* **Attack pattern:** A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).
* **Breath weapon:** Can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon’s current hit points (**save versus breath**for half). Shapes of breath weapon:
**Cloud:** 50’ long, 40’ wide, 20’ high.
**Cone:** 2’ wide at the mouth, 30’ wide at far end.
**Line:** 5’ wide along whole length.
* **Energy immunity:** Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from **fire ball** spells.)
* ***language* and spells:** Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected *magic-user spells* (the listed number and level of spells).
* **Sleeping:** The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!
* **Subduing:** Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks (see ****subduing****), admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000gp per hp.
* **Age:** The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and ¼ or ½ as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.
* **Lairs:** A dragon’s treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.
