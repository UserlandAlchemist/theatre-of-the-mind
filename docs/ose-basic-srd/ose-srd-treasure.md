# Treasures

## Placing Treasure

There are two methods of deciding what treasure is in the possession of monsters: rolling randomly and referee choice.

### Method 1: Rolling Randomly

Monster listings note which treasure type is present in the creature’s lair and which it may carry on its person. See **Treasure Types** for details on how to roll treasure according to a treasure type letter code.

### Manual Adjustments

If the value of the randomly generated treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may adjust the results manually.

### Method 2: Referee Choice

The referee may wish to choose treasures appropriate to the monsters and the PC party. As treasure is the main source of XP (see **Awarding XP**), the referee should carefully consider treasure placement. The following procedure is recommended:

* Consider the size of the adventuring party, the levels of the characters, and the XP they need to go up in level.
* Decide how many experience points the treasure hoard should provide if the party successfully acquires it.
* Place treasures whose total value matches the determined XP total.

### Balance of Reward Versus Danger

When using this approach, the referee should ensure that the treasure is guarded by sufficiently powerful monsters. Adventurers should have to earn this reward!

### Items of Value

#### Common treasures

The treasure tables (see **Treasure Types**) describe methods for generating hoards of coins, gems, jewellery, and magic items.

#### Unusual treasures

Adventures may also include valuable items of other kinds, whose worth may not always be obvious:

* **Artwork:** Paintings, statuary.
* **Books:** Rare tomes or scrolls.
* **Foodstuffs:** Spices, valuable wines.
* **Furnishings:** Rugs, tapestries.
* **Utensils:** Silver cutlery, unusual kitchen or laboratory implements.
* **Valuables:** Furs, ivory, ores, silks.

#### Value and Weight

For each unusual item placed, the referee should note its value (in gold pieces) and (if using the optional rules for **Encumbrance**) its weight.

## Treasure Types

### Rolling Treasure

Each treasure type lists one or more types of coins or items. For each entry in the list:

* If a percentage is given, first roll d100 to see whether this item is present.
* If a range of values is given (e.g. 1d6 × 1,000cp, 6d6 gems), roll the specified dice to determine the quantity of this item that is present.
* For gems, jewellery, and magic items, the procedures for determining the value and properties of the items in the hoard are found in **Gems and Jewellery** and **Magic Items**.

### Manual Adjustments

If the value of randomly rolled treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may adjust the results manually.

### Average Values

The average results of gems, jewellery, and all types of coins, excluding magic items (which have no fixed sale value).

### Coin Conversion Rates

* 1pp = 5gp
* 1gp = 2ep
* 1gp = 10sp
* 1gp = 100cp

### Hoards: A–O

These treasure types indicate the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the monsters’ lair.

**Small lairs:** Monster listings note the number of individuals found in a lair. If the number rolled is below average and the lair encounter size is at least 1d4, the amount of treasure in the hoard may be reduced accordingly.

## Gems and Jewellery

### Gems

The value of each gem in a treasure hoard is determined by the following table:

| d20   | Gem Value |
|-------|-----------|
| 1–4   | 10gp      |
| 5–9   | 50gp      |
| 10–15 | 100gp     |
| 16–19 | 500gp     |
| 20    | 1,000gp   |

### Jewellery

Each piece of jewellery indicated by a treasure type is worth 3d6 × 100gp (or more, if the referee wishes, for characters above 3rd level).

### Damaged Jewellery

Rough treatment of jewellery (e.g. crushing, intense heat or fire, lightning) can damage it, reducing its value by 50%.

### Combining Values

When a treasure type indicates the presence of multiple gems or pieces of jewellery, the referee may combine the values, as desired. For example, a roll of five 50gp value gems may be placed as a single 250gp gem, a 100gp gem and three 50gp gems, or any other combination.

## Magic Items (General)

Magic items are usually classified according to one of the following categories:

* **Armour and shields:** Grant protective benefits to the user.
* **Miscellaneous items:** Enchanted items that do not fit into any other category.
* **Potions:** Magical liquids stored in glass vials.
* **Rings:** Plain or bejewelled rings that place an enchantment about the wearer.
* **Rods / staves / wands:** Magical lengths of wood, metal, crystal, etc. Used by spell casters to unleash magical effects.
* **Scrolls and maps:** Aged sheets of parchment or paper inscribed with either magical script or instructions leading to a treasure hoard. Note that treasure maps are rolled on the magic items table, although they are not usually magical.
* **Swords:** Grant bonuses to hit and damage in combat. May also be enchanted with additional powers.
* **Weapons:** All enchanted weapons other than swords. Grant bonuses to hit and damage in combat. May also be enchanted with additional powers.

### Rolling Magic Items

When a treasure type indicates that a magic item is present, the following procedure is used to determine its nature:

* **Specific type of item:** If the treasure type indicates a specific type of magic item (e.g. 3 potions), roll on the table for that type of item (found by following the links above).
* **Type of item not specified:** Otherwise, first roll on the **Magic Item Type** table below to determine the type of the item, then roll on the table for that type (found by following the links in the table).

### Basic and Expert Magic Items

Separate probabilities are listed in the table for Basic and Expert level characters (i.e. characters of 1st to 3rd level and characters of 4th level or higher). The Basic probabilities are listed in the B column, and the Expert probabilities in the X column.

It is recommended that the probabilities appropriate to the group’s experience level be used. Alternatively, if the referee prefers to have an even distribution of magic items, irrespective of player character level, the Expert probabilities may always be used.

| B: d%  | X: d%  | Type of Item        |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| 01–10  | 01–10  | Armour or Shield     |
| 11–15  | 11–15  | Miscellaneous Item   |
| 16–40  | 16–35  | Potion               |
| 41–45  | 36–40  | Ring                 |
| 46–50  | 41–45  | Rod / Staff / Wand   |
| 51–70  | 46–75  | Scroll or Map        |
| 71–90  | 76–95  | Sword                |
| 91–00  | 96–00  | Weapon               |

### Identifying Magic Items

**Testing:** The most common way of identifying magic items is by trial and error—sipping a potion, donning a suit of armour, using a weapon in battle, etc.

**Retainers:** Players may wish to use retainers as “guinea pigs” to test magic items of unknown properties. Retainers may agree to do this, but only if allowed to keep the item in question.

**By magic:** High-level NPC magic-users may also be able to identify magic items. They will always require payment or a service in kind. The process takes time: possibly several weeks.

### Using Magic Items

**Appropriate use:** In order to be effective, a magic item must be used, held, or worn after the normal fashion for that type of object.

**Concentration:** To activate an item’s magic, the user must concentrate on its effect. When using a magic item in this way, the character cannot take any other actions.

**Items that are always active:** The following items do not require concentration, and are always active: magic swords, weapons, armour, and protective items (e.g. rings of protection).

**Actions per round:** A magic item’s effect can normally be used only once per round, unless its description notes otherwise.

### Wishes

Some magic items grant **wishes**, the powerful ability for a character to change the nature of reality in any conceivable way that they desire. Wishes are generally regarded as the most powerful magic in the game and have the potential to greatly upset the balance of play if not handled carefully by the referee.

### Adjudication Guidelines

**Wording:** The player and referee must pay great attention to the precise wording of a wish.

**Fundamental changes:** A wish that would alter some fundamental aspect of the game or the campaign world will have no effect. For example, a wish that altered the abilities of all monsters of a particular type would fail.

**Greedy wishes:** A wish that the referee judges to be unreasonable or overly greedy may come to pass, but with its intent twisted in some way. For example, a wish for a very powerful magic item may cause the item to appear, but in the possession of a dangerous enemy.

**Wishing for more wishes:** This will result in an infinite time loop, putting the character out of play.

### Example Wishes

Some examples of reasonable wishes:

* Wishing for a weapon to help fight magical monsters. The wish may grant a +1 sword that vanishes when the combat ends.
* Wishing that a monster had not attacked. The wish may place the characters back in time and change the reaction of the monster.
* Wishing that a deadly blow had not occurred. The affected character may return to life, wounded but not dead.

|       | 96–00  | Shield +3                   |

**B:** Basic characters (levels 1–3)
**X:** Expert characters (level 4+)

**Usage:** Per normal class restrictions.

### Cursed Armour and Shields

**AC penalty:** Some types of cursed armour specify an Armour Class penalty. This modifier worsens the wearer’s Armour Class score. For example, a cursed suit of chainmail -1 grants a base Armour Class of 6 [13], one point worse than the AC 5 [14] of non-magical chainmail.

**AC 9 [10]:** Some types of cursed armour give the wearer a base Armour Class of 9 [10] (before modifiers due to Dexterity).

**Testing:** All types of tests indicate that a cursed shield or suit of armour is enchanted with a +1 bonus. It is only when the armour is used in deadly combat that the curse is revealed.

**Removing:** Once a cursed shield or suit of armour has been used, the character comes under the curse and is not able to discard the item. It can only be removed with magic.

### Enchanted Armour and Shields

**AC bonus:** Enchanted armour and shields specify a protective bonus that improves the wearer’s Armour Class score. For example, a suit of chainmail +1 grants a base Armour Class of 4 [15], one point better than the AC 5 [14] of non-magical chainmail.

**Weight:** If using the optional rules for detailed encumbrance (see **Encumbrance**), the enchanted armour’s encumbrance value is 50% less than that of normal armour.

### Type of Armour

The referee may choose the type of armour in a treasure hoard, or may roll on the following table:

| d8   | Type of Armour |
|------|----------------|
| 1–2  | Leather        |
| 3–6  | Chainmail      |
| 7–8  | Plate mail     |

**B:** Basic characters (levels 1–3)
**X:** Expert characters (level 4+)

**Usage:** All characters (unless noted).

**Identifying:** A potion may be identified by sipping a small amount. It is difficult to identify potions purely by smell or taste, as even potions with the same effect are not alike.

**Drinking:** Drinking a full dose of a potion takes one round

**Duration:** The magical effect of a full dose of a potion lasts for 1d6+6 turns. The referee should roll for and track this duration, and not tell the player how long the potion will last for.

### Mixing Potions

Drinking a potion while already under the effects of another potion is dangerous:

* **Sickness:** The character is completely disabled for 3 turns, due to sickness.
* **Cancellation:** The effects of both potions are cancelled.

This rule does not apply to potions with instantaneous or permanent duration.

### Charges

Rods, staves, and wands have a limited number of uses, called “charges”.

**Number of charges:** The number of charges in an item when discovered is determined by the referee, and depends on the type of the item. It is not possible for characters to discover the number of charges in an item.

**Usage:** Each use of the item takes one round and consumes one charge.

**Consuming the last charge:** The item loses its magical potency.

**Recharging:** Is not possible.

### Rods

**Usage:** All characters (unless noted).

**Dimensions:** Thin, 3’ long.

**Charges:** Unless noted, magic rods contain 1d10 charges when found.

### Staves

**Usage:** Spell casters. Some staves may only be used by either arcane or divine spell casters (this is noted in the item’s description).

**Dimensions:** 2” thick, 6’ long.

**Charges:** Unless noted, magic staves contain 3d10 charges when found.

### Staves in Melee

Although magic-users are generally only allowed to use daggers in combat, they are able to use the *staff of power*, *staff of striking*, and *staff of wizardry* in melee.

### Wands

**Usage:** Arcane spell casters.

**Dimensions:** Thin, 1{{1/2}}’ long.

**Charges:** Unless noted, magic wands contain 2d10 charges when found.

|       | 97–98  | Treasure Map: XI          |
|       | 99–00  | Treasure Map: XII         |

**B:** Basic characters (levels 1–3)
**X:** Expert characters (level 4+)

Scrolls are aged sheets of parchment or paper on which magical words have been written by a high-level spell caster.

**One use only:** When a scroll is read, the words disappear.

**Light:** A scroll can only be used if there is enough light to read by.

### Cursed Scroll

**Usage:** All characters (unless noted).

**Activation:** Merely looking at the baneful script on the scroll curses the character. The referee should determine the nature of the curse (see examples below).

**Removing:** A curse can be removed by magic, or (at the referee’s option) by performing a special quest.

### Example Curses

* **Transformation:** The reader changes into a harmless creature (e.g. a frog).
* **Summoning:** A wandering monster appears next to the reader and attacks (gaining surprise). The monster is of equal level to the reader.
* **Lost item:** A magic item in the reader’s possession vanishes. The referee may select the item or choose it at random.
* **Energy drain:** The reader permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the lost level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character’s XP is reduced to halfway between the former and new levels. A person who loses all levels dies.
* **Ability score re-roll:** The player must re-roll the character’s prime requisite.
* **Slow healing:** The reader’s healing capacity is reduced. Natural healing takes double the normal amount of time, and healing spells only cure half the normal number of hit points.

### Protection Scroll

**Usage:** All characters (unless noted). (Written in non-magical languages—usually Common.)

**Activation:** Reading the script aloud conjures a circle of protection against a specific type of monster or energy.

**Area of protection:** When used, conjures a 10’ radius circle of protection around the reader.

**Moving:** If the reader moves, the circle of protection follows them.

### Protection from Elementals

No elemental may enter the circle of protection.

* **Ranged attacks:** The circle does not prevent elementals from using magic or missile attacks against those within it.
* **Breaking:** If anyone within the circle attacks an affected elemental in melee, the circle is broken.
* **Duration:** 2 turns, unless broken.

### Protection from Lycanthropes

A number of lycanthropes are barred from entering the circle of protection. The number depends on their Hit Dice: 1–3 HD: 1d10 lycanthropes affected, 4–5 HD: 1d8 affected, 6+ HD: 1d4 affected.

* **Ranged attacks:** The circle does not prevent lycanthropes from using magic or missile attacks against those within it.
* **Breaking:** If anyone within the circle attacks an affected lycanthrope in melee, the circle is broken.
* **Duration:** 6 turns, unless broken.

### Protection from Magic

Spells and spell-like effects (e.g. from magic items) cannot cross the circle of protection. The barrier prevents magic from entering the circle, but also from leaving it.

* **Duration:** 1d4 turns.
* **Dispelling:** Only by a wish.

### Protection from Undead

A number of undead monsters are barred from entering the circle of protection. The number depends on their Hit Dice: 1–3 HD: 2d12 undead affected, 4–5 HD: 2d6 undead affected, 6+ HD: 1d6 undead affected.

* **Ranged attacks:** The circle does not prevent undead from using magic or missile attacks against those within it.
* **Breaking:** If anyone within the circle attacks an affected undead monster in melee, the circle is broken.
* **Duration:** 6turns, unless broken.

### Spell Scroll

**Usage:** Spell casters.

**Type of magic:** 1-in-4 scrolls contain divine spells; the rest contain arcane spells.

**Activation:** Reading the script aloud conjures the effect of a specific spell. Only arcane spell casters can use scrolls of arcane spells. Only divine spell casters can use scrolls of divine spells.

**Arcane spell scrolls:** Are written in magical script that can only be read by magic.

**Divine spell scrolls:** Are written in normal languages (usually Common), but can only be used by divine spell casters.

**Scrolls of multiple spells:** If a scroll contains multiple spells, only the spell cast disappears from the scroll.

### Spells on a Scroll

The referee may choose the spells or may roll for them randomly. The table below may be used to select the level of each spell on a scroll. (The table lists separate probabilities for Basic and Expert level characters. See **Basic and Expert Magic Items**.)

| B: d6 | X: d%  | Arcane | Divine |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1–3   | 01–25  | 1st    | 1st    |
| 4–5   | 26–50  | 2nd    | 2nd    |
| 6     | 51–70  | 3rd    | 3rd    |
|       | 71–85  | 4th    | 4th    |
|       | 86–95  | 5th    | 5th    |
|       | 96–00  | 6th    | 5th    |

### Treasure Map

**Usage:** All characters (unless noted).

A map that indicates the route to a valuable treasure, located in a dungeon or wilderness.

**Interpreting:** Treasure maps may not always be easy to interpret: a map may be incomplete, worded in riddles, or written in an obscure language.

**Preparing in advance:** The referee should prepare treasure maps in advance.

### Treasures

The following list of treasure map types may be used to determine the nature of the treasure that a map leads to.

* **I:** 1 magic item.
* **II:** 1d6 × 10 gems and 2d10 pieces of jewellery.
* **III:** 2 magic items.
* **IV:** 3 magic items (no swords).
* **V:** 3 magic items and 1 potion.
* **VI:** 3 magic items, 1 scroll, 1 potion.
* **VII:** 5d6 gems and 2 magic items.
* **VIII:** Hoard worth 1d4 × 1,000gp.
* **IX:** Hoard worth 5d6 × 1,000gp.
* **X:** Hoard worth 5d6 × 1,000gp and 1 magic item.
* **XI:** Hoard worth 5d6 × 1,000gp and 5d6 gems.
* **XII:** Hoard worth 6d6 × 1,000gp.

### Hoard Value

For treasure hoards with a listed gold piece value, the referee may choose what type of treasure is in the hoard. (For example, it may be coins, but could also consist of valuable art objects or jewels.)

### Guardians

The treasure is normally guarded by enchantments, traps, or monsters (e.g. a monster from the dungeon encounter tables of levels 5–6, or higher).

**B:** Basic characters (levels 1–3)
**X:** Expert characters (level 4+)

**Usage:** Per normal class restrictions.

### Cursed Swords

**Penalty:** Cursed swords specify a penalty that is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Discarding:** Once the sword has been used in combat, the character comes under the curse and is not able to discard the item. In fact, they will favour the sword and use it whenever possible. The curse can only be removed with magic.

### Enchanted Swords

**Bonus:** Enchanted swords specify a bonus that is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Bonus vs creature type:** Some swords have a special bonus when used against a certain type of creature.

**Bonus vs enchanted creatures:** Magically created or animated monsters, and those summoned by spells or magic items.

### Sentient Swords

Some magic swords have an innate intelligence and personality, along with other special powers. See **Sentient Swords**, for rules for determining the special powers of a sentient sword.

**Probability:** If the referee wishes to randomly determine whether a magic sword is intelligent, the probability is 30%.

### Swords With a Special Purpose

Some magic swords are imbued with a special purpose. Such swords are extremely powerful and are always sentient. See **Sentient Swords**, for rules for determining the powers of a sword with a special purpose.

**Probability:** There is a 1-in-20 chance of a magic sword having a special purpose. The referee may choose to only place such swords by design, rather than rolling this chance randomly.

### Sword +1, Energy Drain

Drains the life energy of its victims.

* **On a successful hit:** The wielder may command the sword to drain the victim’s life energy.
* **Energy drain:** In addition to suffering normal damage, the target permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character’s XP is reduced to the lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels dies.
* **Charges:** The sword may drain a total of 1d4+4 levels. Once this many levels have been drained, it becomes a normal magical sword +1.

### Sword +1, Flaming

Bursts into flames, on command. When flaming:

* **Casts light:** In 30’ radius.
* **Can set things alight:** Treated as a torch, for purposes of setting things on fire (e.g. a *web* spell).
* **Inflicts fire damage:** Which may have special effects on certain creatures.
* **Grants an attack bonus:** Against certain types of creature:
    * +2 vs trolls (or other creatures that cannot regenerate fire damage).
    * +2 vs pegasi, hippogriffs, and rocs (or other bird-like creatures).
    * +3 vs treants (or other plant-based creatures).
    * +3 vs undead.
* **Duration:** The sword blazes until commanded to cease.

### Sword +1, Light

On command, produces light in a 30’ radius.

### Sword +2, Charm Person

* **Usage frequency:** The power may be used up to three times a week.

### Sword +1, Locate Objects

Grants the wielder the ability to detect the presence of objects within 120’.

* **Effect:** This works in the same way as the magic-user spell *locate object*.
* **Usage frequency:** The power may be used once per day.

### Sword +1, Wishes

Has the power to grant the wielder’s *wishes*.

* **Charges:** The sword grants a total of 1d4 wishes.

## Sentient Swords

If a magic sword possesses sentience (see **Swords** for the likelihood), the procedure on this page may be used to determine its powers. (Alternatively, the referee may select its qualities as desired.)

### Rolling a Sentient Sword

* **Special purpose:** If the sword has a special purpose, see **Special Purpose of Sentient Swords** to determine what it is.
* **Intelligence and personality:** The sword’s INT is 1d6+6. (Swords imbued with a special purpose always have INT 12.) The sword has its own personality and should be played as an NPC.
* **Communication:** The sword’s INT determines the means by which it can communicate. See the table below.
    * **Empathy:** The sword cannot communicate directly, but empathically informs the wielder of its powers and how to use them.
    * **Speech:** The sword speaks out loud. The number of languages it knows is indicated by rolling on the languages table, see below. Languages should be selected by the referee.
    * **Reading:** The sword can read all languages it can speak, as well as magical inscriptions.
* **Alignment:** See the table below.
* **Powers:** The sword’s INT determines the number of powers it has. See the table below. Powers are described in the links below.
* **Ego:** Sentient swords have an **Ego** rating—a measure of their force of personality. This is rolled on 1d12. Swords imbued with a special purpose always have an Ego of 12.

| INT | Reading | Communication |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| 7   | No      | Empathy       |
| 8   | No      | Empathy       |
| 9   | No      | Empathy       |

### Using a Sentient Sword

Sentient swords grant the wielder special powers beyond those of a normal magic sword, but using one also carries risks.

### Activating Powers

* **In hand:** To use a power, the sword must be in the wielder’s hand.
* **Concentration:** The wielder must concentrate to activate a power.

### Alignment

The alignment of the sword can only be determined by touching it. Doing so may incur damage if the character is of a different alignment to the sword:

* **Lawful swords:** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to neutral characters and 2d6 per round to chaotic characters.
* **Neutral swords:** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to non-neutral characters.
* **Chaotic swords:** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to neutral characters and 2d6 per round to lawful characters.

### Control

A sentient sword has its own personality and can, at times, attempt to exercise control over the person who wields it. A control check (see below) is triggered in any of the following circumstances:

* **First contact:** Upon the character first touching the sword.
* **Wounded:** When the character is reduced to half hit points or less.
* **Jealousy:** When another magic weapon comes into the character’s possession.
* **Alignment difference:** Upon every use, if the sword and the character are of different alignments.
* **Special purpose:** If the sword has a special purpose: every time the special purpose is applicable. (e.g. when encountering a character or creature of the type the sword is designed to slay.)

### Control Checks

When one of the aforementioned circumstances occurs, a control check is required:

* Determine the sword’s Will score:
    * The sum of its INT and Ego.
    * Add one for each extraordinary power the sword has.
    * Add 1d10 if the sword and the wielder of are different alignments.
* Determine the wielder’s Will score:
    * The sum of STR and WIS scores.
    * If the character has less than full hit points, Will is reduced by 1d4 (or 2d4 if the character has less than half hit points).
* Compare the Will scores. If the sword’s Will score is higher, it takes control of the character’s actions.

### When the Sword Takes Control

The referee determines the behaviour of the character, via the sword, for example:

* **Jealousy:** Discarding other weapons, or ignoring newly discovered magic weapons.
* **Glory:** Charging into battle, in order to gain glory for the sword.
* **Surrender:** To a foe whom the sword deems either more worthy of possessing it or more susceptible to being controlled.
* **Indulgence:** Making lavish expenditures for the sword. Purchasing expensive sheaths, having jewels fitted, having enchantments and wards applied, etc. The sword may force the character to spend most of their money on such things!

### Ending Control

Once in control, the sword will only release the character when the circumstance that triggered the control check is over or when the sword is otherwise satisfied.

### Extraordinary Powers

Each power should be rolled on the table below. Duplicates should be re-rolled, unless noted.

**Usage frequency:** Unless a power’s description notes otherwise, it may be used at most three times a day.

### Special Purpose

Some sentient swords are also imbued with a special purpose. The purpose of such swords is typically to slay a certain type of character or creature. The purpose may be rolled on the table below, or the referee may invent others.

| d6 | Type of Target to be Slain                                                                 |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Arcane spell casters                                                                       |
| 2  | Divine spell casters                                                                       |
| 3  | Warriors (e.g. fighters or other primarily combat-oriented, non-spell casting classes, including non-spell casting demihumans) |

### Alignment Power

In addition to their sensory and extraordinary powers, swords of special purpose have an extra power when used to achieve their designated purpose (e.g. when attacking the enemy the sword was designed to slay). This power depends on the sword’s alignment:

* **Lawful:** Chaotic foes hit by the sword must **save versus spells** or be paralysed.
* **Neutral:** The wielder gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws.
* **Chaotic:** Lawful foes hit by the sword must **save versus spells** or be turned to stone.
