# 2nd Level

## Continual Light (Continual Darkness)

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 120’
This spell has three usages:

* **Conjuring light:** In a 30’ radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case the light moves with the object.
* **Blinding a creature:** By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack.
* **Cancelling darkness:** ''Continual light'' may cancel a ''continual darkness'' spell (see below).

### Reversed: Continual Darkness

Creates a 30’ radius area of magical blackness, preventing both normal sight and infravision. Light sources brought within the area of darkness do not illuminate it. Like ''continual light'', it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a ''continual light'' spell.

## Detect Evil

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** 60’
Objects under an evil enchantment and living beings with evil intentions are caused to magically glow.

* **Intent only:** The caster cannot read the thoughts of creatures with evil intent.
* **Definition of evil:** The referee must judge what is classified as evil. Beings of chaotic alignment do not always have evil intent. Traps and poisons, while potentially harmful, are not evil.

## Detect Invisible

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 10’ per level
Invisible creatures or items in range are revealed to the caster.

## ESP

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 12 turns  
**Range:** 60’
This spell grants the caster the ability to perceive and understand the thoughts of other living creatures.

* **Focus for 1 turn:** To pick up thoughts, the caster must focus their concentration in one direction for one turn.
* **After this turn:** The thoughts of all creatures within range in that direction can be perceived.
* **Multiple creatures:** If multiple creatures are within range in the direction being focused on, the caster perceives an incomprehensible mix of all their thoughts. If the caster focuses for an additional turn, they can filter out and understand a single creature’s thoughts.
* **Meaning:** The caster can magically understand thoughts in languages they do not speak.
* **Obstructions:** ''ESP' is obstructed by a thin layer of lead or by rock of 2’ thick or greater.

## Invisibility

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent (but may be broken, see below)  
**Range:** 240’
The caster or another creature or object within range becomes invisible:

* **If cast on a creature:** Any gear the subject is carrying is also rendered invisible (this includes clothing and armour). Items subsequently put down become visible. If the subject attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken, ending the spell.
* **If cast on an object:** The invisibility is permanent.
* **Light sources:** If a light source is made invisible (either as part of a creature’s gear or as an individual object), the light it casts is unaffected.

## Knock

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 1 round  
**Range:** 60’
Causes locked, barred, secured, or stuck doors, gates, chests, and so forth to open.

* **Magically held doors:** Are affected (e.g. ''hold portal'', ''wizard lock'').
* **Secret doors:** May be opened, but they must be known to the caster.

## Levitate

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns +1 per level  
**Range:** The caster
This enchantment allows the caster to move up and down through the air:

* **Vertical:** Vertical movement as desired, at up to 20’ per round.
* **Horizontal:** The caster can move laterally by pushing against solid objects.
* **Weight:** A normal amount of weight can be carried while levitating.

## Locate Object

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** 60’ +10’ per level
The caster can sense the direction (but not distance) of an object. One of two types of object may be located:

* **General class:** An object of a general class (e.g. a stairway, an altar, etc). In this case, the nearest object of the type is located.
* **Specific object:** A specific object known to the caster.

**Restrictions:** This spell cannot be used to locate creatures.

## Mirror Image

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** The caster
1d4 illusory images of the caster appear.

* **Behaviour:** The mirror images look and behave exactly as the caster.
* **Attacks on the caster:** Destroy one of the mirror images (even if the attack misses).

## Phantasmal Force

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Concentration  
**Range:** 240’
A visual illusion of the caster’s choosing manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:

* **An illusionary monster:** That can be directed to attack. The monster has an Armour Class of 9 [10] and will vanish if hit in combat.
* **An illusionary attack:** For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who **save versus spells** are unaffected.
* **A scene:** Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.

**Stipulations:** The following apply:

* **Concentration:** Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends.
* **Illusionary monsters or attacks:** May appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever inflicted. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
* **Illusions from imagination:** If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.

## Web

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 48 turns  
**Range:** 10’
Conjures a volume of sticky webbing, blocking a 10’ cube area.

* **Entanglement:** Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibres. Entangled creatures can’t move, but can break free depending on their strength (see below).
* **Flammable:** The web can be destroyed by fire in two rounds. All creatures caught within flaming webs suffer 1d6 damage from the flames.

**Breaking free:** Depends on STR:

* **Normal human range:** The creature can break free in 2d4 turns.
* **Magically augmented STR above 18:** The creature can break free in 4 rounds.
* **Giant strength:** The creature can break free in 2 rounds.

## Wizard Lock

**Level:** 2nd  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 10’
A ''wizard lock'' spell magically locks a door, gate, similar portal, or any item that has a lock. The magical lock is permanent but may be bypassed as follows:

* **The caster:** Can freely pass through any portals locked by their own spell.
* **A ''knock'' spell:** Allows passage.
* **Higher level casters:** Magic-using characters 3 or more levels higher than the caster of ''wizard lock'' may pass.
* **Temporary:** Bypassing does not destroy a ''wizard lock''.
