# 5th Level

## Animate Dead

**Level:** 5th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 60’

Causes corpses or skeletons to rise as undead skeletons or zombies.

* **Obedient:** Created undead obey the caster’s commands.
* **Special abilities:** They are unable to use any special abilities (including spell casting) that they possessed in life.
* **Duration:** The reanimating magic remains active until dispelled or until the undead are slain.

**Number:** The spell animates up to 1 Hit Die of zombies or skeletons per level of the caster:

* **Skeletons:** Have AC 7 [12] and HD equal to those the creature had in life.
* **Zombies:** Have AC 8 [11] and HD one greater than the creature had in life.
* **Classed characters:** If a PC or NPC with levels in a class is reanimated by this spell, the levels are not counted as HD. For example, the reanimated corpse of a 5th level fighter would have 2 HD (1 HD as a normal human, +1 for being reanimated as a zombie).

## Cloudkill

**Level:** 5th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 30’
A poisonous fog streams from the caster’s fingertips, filling a 30’ diameter area.

* **Movement:** The fog moves at 60’ (20’), driven by the wind or, in still conditions, away from the caster.
* **Sinking:** Because the fog is denser than air, it sinks to the lowest point, flowing down hills, into holes, and so forth.
* **Damage:** All creatures in contact with the fog suffer 1 damage per round.
* **Creatures with less than 5 Hit Dice:** Must also **save versus death** (once per round of contact) or die.

## Conjure Elemental

**Level:** 5th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent (until dismissed or slain)  
**Range:** 240’
A 16 Hit Dice elemental—a being formed of pure elemental matter—is summoned from an elemental plane of the caster’s choice (air, earth, fire, water) to do the caster’s bidding.

* **Materials:** The summons requires a large volume of the appropriate element.
* **Concentration:** Is required to command an elemental.
* **Dismissing:** While control over the elemental is maintained, the caster may dismiss it at any time, sending it back to its plane of origin.
* **Disruption:** If the caster moves at more than half speed or their concentration is disturbed, the command over the elemental ends. It is, henceforth, a free-willed entity and will immediately try to kill the caster and any who get in its way.
* **Dispelling:** A conjured elemental may be dispelled by ''dispel magic'' or ''dispel evil''.

**Restrictions:** The caster may summon at most one elemental from each plane in a single day.

## Contact Higher Plane

**Level:** 5th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** One conversation  
**Range:** The caster
A channel of communication is opened to a higher plane of existence, allowing the caster to ask powerful, otherworldly beings for advice and knowledge on any subject.

* **Plane:** The caster must choose which plane of existence to contact: communion with beings of the 3rd to 12th planes is possible via this spell. Higher numbered planes are home to more powerful and knowledgeable beings.
* **Questions:** The caster may then ask a number of simple yes/no questions equal to the number of the plane contacted. The referee plays the role of the contacted being, responding to the caster’s questions.
* **Answers:** For each question asked, there is a chance of the contacted being not knowing the answer or of answering untruthfully: see the table below. It is impossible to detect whether the entity is lying.

**Restrictions:** Casting ''contact higher plane'' is a great and perilous deed.

* **Usage limit:** It may be cast at most once per week. (The referee may limit the spell’s usage to even less frequently, if desired.)
* **Insanity:** Communion with otherworldly beings of great power can shatter the caster’s sanity. The basic chance is shown in the table below. For every level of the caster above 11, this chance is reduced by 5%. If the caster is driven insane as a result of the communion, the recovery time is a number of weeks equal to the number of the plane contacted.

| Plane | #Qs | Don’t Know | Truth | Insanity |
|-------|-----|------------|-------|----------|
| 3rd   |  3  | 75%        | 50%   |  5%      |
| 4th   |  4  | 70%        | 55%   | 10%      |
| 5th   |  5  | 65%        | 60%   | 15%      |
| 6th   |  6  | 60%        | 65%   | 20%      |
| 7th   |  7  | 50%        | 70%   | 25%      |
| 8th   |  8  | 40%        | 75%   | 30%      |
| 9th   |  9  | 30%        | 80%   | 35%      |
| 10th  | 10  | 20%        | 85%   | 40%      |
| 11th  | 11  | 10%        | 90%   | 45%      |
| 12th  | 12  |  5%        | 95%   | 50%      |

**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent

**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns +1 per level

* **Against an individual:** The target’s saving throw is penalised by -2.
* **Against a group:** 1d4 individuals in the group are targeted.

**Restrictions:** Undead are not affected.

## Magic Jar

**Level:** 5th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Special  
**Range:** The caster
The caster’s body enters a comatose trance as their life-force is transferred into a receptacle (any inanimate object within 30’), known as a ''magic jar''. From there, the caster may attempt to possess the bodies of other creatures.

**When the caster’s life-force is in the magic jar:**

* **Possession:** The caster may attempt to possess the body of another creature within 120’. The victim may **save versus spells** to resist possession. If the save is successful, the caster may not make another attempt to possess that victim for one turn. If the save fails, the caster’s life-force leaves the magic jar and enters the victim, possessing it.
* **Returning:** The caster may choose to return to their own body at any time, ending the spell.
* **If the magic jar is destroyed:** The caster dies.
* **If the caster’s own body is destroyed:** Their life-force is stranded in the magic jar.

**When the caster’s life-force is possessing a victim:**

* **Control:** The caster gains full control over the victim’s body, but is not able to make the victim cast spells.
* **If the magic jar is destroyed:** The spell ends and the caster’s life-force is trapped in the possessed body.
* **If the possessed victim is killed:** The caster’s life-force returns to the magic jar.
* **Dispelling:** ''Dispel evil'' forces the caster’s life-force back into the magic jar.
* **If the caster’s own body is destroyed:** Their life-force is stranded in the body of the creature being possessed.

## Pass-Wall

**Range:** 30’

## Telekinesis

**Level:** 5th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Concentration (up to 6 rounds)  
**Range:** 120’
By concentrating, the caster is able to move objects or creatures by the power of thought.

* **Weight:** Up to 200 coins of weight per level of the caster may be targeted.
* **Movement:** The target may be moved up to 20’ per round, in whatever direction the caster wishes (including vertically).

## Teleport

**Level:** 5th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** 10’
The caster or a chosen creature vanishes and reappears at a location of the caster’s choosing.

* **Gear:** The subject is teleported with all its gear, up to its maximum load.
* **Unwilling subjects:** May **save versus spells** to prevent the teleportation.
* **Destination:** May be at any distance, but must be known to the caster. The destination must be an open space at ground level. (It is not possible to intentionally teleport the subject into mid-air or into solid matter.)
* **Risk:** There is a risk, when teleporting, of accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The chance of a successful teleportation depends on the caster’s knowledge of the destination (see below). Roll d% and consult the table below.

| Knowledge of Dest. | Ground Level | Too High | Too Low |
|--------------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Scant              | 01–50        | 51–75    | 76–00   |
| Moderate           | 01–80        | 81–90    | 91–00   |
| Exact              | 01–95        | 96–99    | 00      |

**Ground level:** The subject appears at the intended destination.

**Too high:** The subject appears 1d10×10’ above the intended destination. If this causes the subject to appear inside solid matter, they die instantly. Otherwise, the subject falls from a height.

**Too low:** The subject appears below the surface of the ground and dies instantly.

**Knowledge of destination:** The caster’s knowledge of the destination is rated as follows:

* **Scant:** A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions.
* **Moderate:** A location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying for several weeks.
* **Exact:** A location that the caster has made a detailed study of, in person.
