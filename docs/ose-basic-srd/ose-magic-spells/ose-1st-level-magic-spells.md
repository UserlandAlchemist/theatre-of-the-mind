# 1st Level

## Charm Person

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** One or more days (see below)  
**Range:** 120’
A single human, demihuman, or human-like monster (''see **Persons**) must **save versus spells** or be charmed, as follows:

* **Friendship:** The subject regards the caster as a close friend and will come to the caster’s defence.
* **Commands:** If they share a language, the caster may give the charmed creature commands, which they will obey.
* **Subject’s nature:** The subject may resist commands that contradict their habits or alignment.
* **Suicidal commands:** Are always refused.

**Restrictions:** Undead and human-like monsters of greater than 4+1 HD (see **Hit point modifiers**) are not affected.

**Duration:** The charm lasts indefinitely, but the subject is allowed to make further **saves versus spells** at intervals, depending on their INT score. If one of these saves succeeds, the spell ends.

* **INT 3–8:** New save once every month.
* **INT 9–12:** New save each week.
* **INT 13–18:** New save once every day.

## Detect Magic

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** 60’
Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures are caused to glow. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed.

## Floating Disc

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 6’
Conjures an invisible disc of magical force that can be used to carry loads.

* **Dimensions:** The disc is shaped like a round shield: around 3 feet across and slightly concave.
* **Load:** It can hold a maximum load of 5,000 coins (500 pounds).
* **Motion:** The disc floats at waist height, following the caster as they move.
* **End:** Anything placed on the disc is dropped when it disappears at the end of the spell’s duration.

## Hold Portal

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 2d6 turns  
**Range:** 10’
Magically prevents a portal (e.g. door, gate, etc.) from being opened.

* **Opening by magic:** A ''knock'' spell opens the held portal instantly.
* **Opening by force:** Creatures with at least 3 Hit Dice more than the caster can open the held portal with one round of effort.

## Light (Darkness)

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns +1 per level  
**Range:** 120’
This spell has three usages:

* **Conjuring light:** In a 15’ radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case the light moves with the object.
* **Blinding a creature:** By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack.
* **Cancelling darkness:** ''Light'' may cancel a ''darkness'' spell (see below).

### Reversed: Darkness

Creates a 15’ radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like ''light'', it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a ''light'' spell.

## Magic Missile

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 1 turn  
**Range:** 150’
This spell conjures a glowing dart of energy that the caster may choose to shoot at a visible target within range.

* **Hit:** The missile hits unerringly (no attack roll or saving throw is required).
* **Damage:** The missile inflicts 1d6+1 damage.
* **Higher level casters:** May conjure more missiles: two additional missiles are conjured per five experience levels the caster has gained (i.e. three missiles at 6th–10th level, five missiles at 11th–15th level, etc.). Multiple missiles may be directed at a single target.

## Protection from Evil

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** The caster
This spell wards the caster from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows:

* **Bonuses:** The caster gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
* **Affected creatures’ attacks:** Against the caster are penalised by -1.
* **Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures:** The spell additionally prevents such creatures from attacking the caster in melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If the caster engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (the caster still gains the save and attack bonuses mentioned above).

## Read Languages

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** The caster
The caster gains the ability to understand written information in any language, including coded messages or symbols (e.g. on treasure maps). No ability to ''speak'' unknown languages is conferred.

## Read Magic

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 1 turn  
**Range:** The caster
Allows the caster to decipher magical script or runes, as follows:

* **Scrolls:** The magical script of a scroll of arcane spells can be understood. The caster is then able to activate the scroll at any time in the future.
* **Spell books:** A spell book written by another arcane spell caster can be deciphered.
* **Inscriptions:** Runes or magical words inscribed on an object or surface can be understood.
* **Reading again:** Once the caster has used this spell to decipher a magical inscription, they can always understand that script again without ''read magic''.

## Shield

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** The caster
Conjures a barrier of magic that gives the caster an improved AC:

## Sleep

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 4d4 turns  
**Range:** 240’
Causes creatures (except undead) to fall into a magical slumber. The spell may target either:

* A single creature with 4+1 Hit Dice (see **Hit point modifiers**).
* A total of 2d8 Hit Dice of creatures of 4 HD or lower each.

When targeting creatures of 4 HD or less, the following rules apply:

* **Weakest first:** Targets with the least HD are affected first.
* **HD:** Treat monsters with less than 1 HD as having 1 HD and monsters with a fixed hit point bonus as having the flat HD. (For example, a 3+2 HD monster would be treated as having 3 HD.)

**Killing:** A single attack with a bladed weapon can kill a creature enchanted by this spell.

**Awakening:** Enchanted creatures can be forcefully awakened (e.g. by slapping).

## Ventriloquism

**Level:** 1st  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 2 turns
