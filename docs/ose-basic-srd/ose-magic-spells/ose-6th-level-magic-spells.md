# 6th Level

## Anti-Magic Shell

**Level:** 6th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** 12 turns  
**Range:** The caster
Wreathes the caster in an anti-magic barrier.

* **Blocks magic:** The barrier blocks all spells and spell effects in both directions, including spells cast by the caster.
* **Dismissing:** At any time the caster wishes, they may dismiss the barrier, ending the spell.

## Control Weather

**Level:** 6th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Concentration  
**Range:** 240 yards around the caster
By concentrating (no movement allowed), the caster causes one of the following conditions to manifest in the surrounding area. This spell only functions outdoors.

* **Calm:** Clears bad weather (though side-effects—e.g. mud after rain—remain.)
* **Extreme heat:** Dries up snow or mud (including ''transmute rock to mud''). Creatures in the area move at half normal rate.
* **Fog:** Visibility drops to 20’. Creatures in the fog move at half their normal rate. At the referee’s option, they may also have a chance of getting lost.
* **High winds:** Movement rates are halved. Missile fire and flight are impossible. High winds may be used to increase the sailing speed of ships by 50%, if they travel with the wind. In sandy areas, may cause a sandstorm, reducing visibility to 20’.
* **Rain:** -2 penalty to missile attacks. Mud forms in 3 turns, halving movement rates.
* **Snow:** Visibility drops to 20’. Movement rates are halved. Bodies of water may freeze. After the snow thaws, mud remains and still impedes movement.
* **Tornado:** Conjures a whirlwind that the caster directs, moving 120’ per round and attacking as directed (see stats below). Ships caught in a tornado have a 75% chance of suffering 12 points of hull damage.

### Tornado

A whirling column of air, 24’ high and 6’ across, that wreaks havoc for flying creatures and ships.

**AC:** 0 [19]  
**HD:** 12* (54hp)  
**Attacks:** 1 × blow (2d8)  
**THAC0:** 10 [+9]  
**Move:** 360’ (120’) flying  
**Saves:** D6 W7 P8 B8 S10 (12)  
**Morale:** 10  
**Alignment:** Neutral  
**XP:** 1,900

* **Whirlwind:** Creatures with less than 2HD swept aside (**save versus death**).
* **Mundane damage immunity:** Can only be harmed by magical attacks.
* **Harm flying creatures:** Inflict extra 1d8 damage.

## Death Spell

**Level:** 6th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** 240’
Up to 4d8 Hit Dice of creatures within a 60’ cube area must **save versus death** or die, instantly.

**Restrictions:** Undead and creatures with greater than 7 Hit Dice are unaffected.

## Disintegrate

**Level:** 6th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** 60’
The material form of a single, non-magical creature or object is instantly and permanently destroyed.

* **If a creature is targeted:** It may **save versus death** to resist ''disintegration''.
* **Examples of objects:** The following might be targeted: a tree, a ship, a 10’ section of wall.

## Geas (Remove Geas)

**Level:** 6th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent / Instant (''remove geas'')  
**Range:** 30’
The caster commands a subject to perform or avoid performing a specific action.

* **Examples:** Bringing a specific item to the caster, eating or drinking without restraint, keeping a certain fact secret.
* **Impossible or deadly tasks:** The prescribed ''geas'' must not be impossible or directly deadly—if such a ''geas'' is cast, it affects the caster, instead.
* **Saving throw:** The subject may **save versus spells**, to avoid coming under the spell’s effect.
* **If the save fails:** The subject must follow the stipulated course of action or suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by the referee (e.g. penalties to attack, ability score reductions, inability to memorize spells, physical torment and feebleness, etc.).

### Reversed: Remove Geas

Can dispel an active ''geas'' spell and any incurred penalties. A ''geas'' placed by a lower level caster is automatically dispelled. A ''geas'' created by a higher level caster has a 5% chance per level difference of not being dispelled.

## Invisible Stalker

**Level:** 6th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** One mission  
**Range:** Summoned to caster’s presence
An invisible stalker (see below) is summoned to the caster’s presence and magically bound to perform a mission of the caster’s choosing.

* **Wording:** The caster must be careful with the wording of the mission. Invisible stalkers are treacherous and, unless the assigned mission can be easily and quickly accomplished, will follow the letter of the command while twisting the intent.
* **Duration:** The creature is bound to attempt the mission until it succeeds or is destroyed.
* **Banishing:** The spell ''dispel evil'' will banish an invisible stalker, ending the spell.

### Invisible Stalker (Stats)

Highly intelligent, magical creatures summoned from another plane of existence to perform tasks for powerful magic-users.

**Range:** 240’
An illusory duplicate of the caster appears within range.

* **Spells and missiles:** The image appears unaffected by spells or missile weapons.
* **Melee or touch:** If the image is touched or hit in melee, it disappears.

## Reincarnation

**Level:** 6th  
**Type:** Magic-User  
**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** Appears in the caster’s presence
A dead character is returned to life in a new physical form that manifests in the presence of the caster. The character’s new body is not necessarily the same as the original; it is determined by rolling on the **Reincarnated Class** table below.

The roll indicates either a character class or a monster:

* **Character class:** The character is of experience level 1d6 (or at most the same level as the character achieved before death). The reincarnated character can continue to gain experience and advance as normal, in the new class.
* **Monster:** The type should be determined by the referee. The monster should be at least partially intelligent, have Hit Dice no greater than the level of the character being reincarnated (at most 6 HD), and be of the same alignment. The tables below may be used, or the referee may create their own tables. Monsters cannot gain experience or advance in level.
