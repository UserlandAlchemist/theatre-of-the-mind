# Characters

## Game Statistics

Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.

### Ability Scores

The basic physical and mental strengths and weaknesses of the character. There are 6 ability scores: **Strength** (abbreviated STR), **Intelligence** (INT), **Wisdom** (WIS), **Dexterity** (DEX), **Constitution** (CON), and **Charisma** (CHA). A character is ranked in each *ability score* by a number between 3–18. (3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best.)

### Class

An adventuring profession to which the character belongs. A character’s class defines their main abilities. See *Character Classes*.

### Race

A character may be human or one of a number of demihuman species. Unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is assumed to be human.

### Level

The character’s experience as an adventurer is denoted by their experience level. Characters typically start play at 1st level (the lowest level of adventurer) and can increase in level through successful adventuring. As a character goes up in level, they gain more powerful abilities, as defined by their class.

### Experience Points (XP)

The character’s advancement in the game is tracked by the accumulation of experience points. Experience points are awarded by the referee after a successful adventure. When the character has accumulated a certain number of experience points, the character’s level increases. Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each experience level.

### Prime Requisite

The ability score (or scores) that are the most important to the character’s class. The character’s score in these abilities can affect the rate at which the character accumulates experience points.

### Alignment

The character (and every other creature in the game world) is aligned with one of three cosmic principles: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos (see *Alignment*). This alignment determines how certain magic influences the character and should be used by the player as a guideline for role-playing the character.

### Hit Points (hp)

The character’s ability to avoid dying. The character has a **maximum hit point total** and a **current hit point total**, which are tracked separately. When a character is harmed, their current hit point total is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the character is dead! Rest or healing can restore lost hit points (see *Damage, Healing, and Death*), but never above the character’s maximum hit point total (this is only increased when the character increases in level).

### Hit Dice (HD)

The number of dice used to determine the character’s maximum hit point total. The character’s level determines the number of Hit Dice and their class determines the type of dice rolled (i.e. d4, d6, d8). (Some classes also grant a flat bonus to hit points at certain levels.)

### Armour Class (AC)

The character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. AC is determined by the character’s armour and their Dexterity score. Lower Armour Class scores are better, so bonuses decrease the character’s AC and penalties increase it.

**Dual format:** The equivalent ascending AC is listed in square brackets, for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g. AC 5 [14] — an AC of 5, or 14 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)

**Unarmoured AC:** An unarmoured character has AC 9 [10].

### Ascending AC (Optional Rule)

Some groups are more familiar with an Armour Class system where higher scores are better. This system is known as Ascending Armour Class (abbreviated AAC) and works as follows:

* **Armour Class:** When using AAC, higher scores are better. Bonuses to Armour Class increase the AAC score and penalties decrease it.
* **Attack rolls:** When using AAC, the procedure for resolving attack rolls involves the use of an attack bonus instead of a THAC0 score and attack matrix.

**Note:** Using Ascending Armour Class results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of descending AC with an attack matrix.

### Attack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0)

The character’s ability to hit foes in combat, determined by their class and level. The THAC0 score indicates which row of the attack matrix (see *Combat Tables*) to use when attacking. Lower THAC0 scores are better.

**Dual format:** The equivalent attack bonus is listed in square brackets, for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g. THAC0 15 [+4] — a THAC0 of 15, or an attack bonus of +4 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)

**Attacking:** The procedure for making attack rolls is described in *Combat*.

### Saving Throw Values

The character’s ability to avoid certain dangerous or detrimental effects. There are five saving throw categories: death (or poison), wands, paralysis (or petrification), breath attacks, spells (or magic rods or staves). The character’s saving throw values are determined by class and level. See *Saving Throws* for full details.

### Movement Rate

The speed at which the character can move when exploring, travelling, or during combat. Every character has a **base movement rate** and an **encounter movement rate** (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one third of the base movement rate. The default movement rate for characters is 120’ (40’)—a base movement rate of 120’ and an encounter movement rate of 40’.

* **Overland:** The number of miles a character can travel in a day in the wilderness is determined by dividing their base movement rate by five.
* **Exploration:** When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their base movement rate in feet per turn (10 minutes)

### Class Abilities

Finally, the character’s class denotes a set of special abilities that the character may use, including the ability to use certain types of armour and weapons and to speak one or more *languages*.

## Creating a Character

To create a character, you’ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character.

A selection of different character sheet PDFs is available at necroticgnome.com. These may be downloaded and printed for use in your games.

### 1. Roll Ability Scores

Roll 3d6 for each of your character’s ability scores: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma. See *Ability Scores*.

#### Sub-Par Characters

If you roll a character with very poor ability scores—for example an 8 or less in every score or an extremely low rating in more than one ability—the referee may allow you to discard the character and start again.

### 2. Choose a Class

Select one of the classes available (see *Character Classes*), bearing in mind the minimum ability score requirements of some classes. The chosen class determines your character’s race—unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is human.

### 3. Adjust Ability Scores

If you wish, you may raise your character’s prime requisite(s) of your character by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. For every two points by which an ability score is reduced, one point may be added to a prime requisite. The following restrictions apply:

* Only Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way.
* No score may be lowered below 9.
* Some character classes may have additional constraints.

### 4. Note Ability Score Modifiers

Now that your character’s ability scores are fixed, make a note of any associated bonuses or penalties (see *Ability Scores*).

### 5. Note Attack Values

The level progression chart for your character’s class lists your THAC0 score. This indicates your chance of hitting opponents in combat, as determined by the *Combat Tables|Attack Matrix*.

For quick reference, it is convenient to look up the values in the attack matrix row corresponding to character’s THAC0 (determined by class and level) and record them on your character sheet. 1st level characters have a THAC0 of 19 [0], resulting in the attack values shown below.

#### While useing Ascending AC (Optional Rule)

If using the optional rule for *Game Statistics#Ascending AC (Optional Rule)|Ascending AC*, record your attack bonus on your character sheet, instead of the attack matrix quick reference.

| Attack Roll | AC Hit |
|-------------|--------|
| 10          | 9      |
| 11          | 8      |
| 12          | 7      |
| 13          | 6      |
| 14          | 5      |
| 15          | 4      |
| 16          | 3      |
| 17          | 2      |
| 18          | 1      |
| 19          | 0      |

### 6. Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities

Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of their class, as well as your character’s saving throws. If your character has a spell book, ask your referee which *spells* are recorded in it. The referee may allow you to choose.

### 7. Roll Hit Points

Determine your character’s hit points by rolling the die type appropriate to the chosen class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see *Ability Scores*). Your character always starts with at least 1 hit point, regardless of CON modifier.

#### Re-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule)

If your roll for hit points comes up 1 or 2 (before applying any CON modifier), the referee may allow you to re-roll. This is in order to increase the survivability of 1st level PCs.

### 8. Choose Alignment

Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (see *Alignment*) and note this on your character sheet.

### 9. Note Known Languages

Your character’s native languages are listed in the class description. This always includes the common tongue and the character’s alignment language—see *Languages*. Characters with high INT may also choose additional languages from the list of languages available in the setting.

### 10. Buy Equipment

Your character starts play with 3d6 × 10 gold pieces (see *Wealth*). You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under **Equipment & Services**.

**Remember:** Your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g. weapons and armour).

### 11. Note Armour Class

Your character’s Armour Class is determined by two factors:

* **Armour:** The armour worn determines your character’s base AC. See the equipment lists under *Weapons And Armour#Armour|Armour*).
* **Dexterity:** See *Ability Scores*.

#### Unarmoured AC

If your character has no armour, their base AC is 9 [10].

### 12. Note Level and XP

Your character begins play at 1st level with 0 XP.

## #13. Name Character

Finally, choose a name for your character. You are now ready for adventure!

## Ability Scores (Character)

A character’s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game. The tables below list the modifiers associated with each ability score, with the effects described below.

## Prime Requisite (XP Boost)

Each character class has one or more prime requisites—ability scores of special importance to that class’ function. A character’s score in their prime requisites affects how quickly they gain XP.

* **XP modifier:** Applied to all XP awarded to characters with a single prime requisite. The modifiers for classes with multiple prime requisites are noted in the class description.

| Prime Requisite | XP Modifier |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 3–5             | -20%        |

## Alignment (Character)

Alignments are cosmic principles that represent broad world views. All beings are categorised under one of three alignments: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos.

**Law:** The belief in goodness, order, truth, and justice as the natural order of the universe. Lawful beings are trustworthy, believe in protecting others, and act for the good of the group. They obey the rules of society and strive for fairness and justice.

**Neutrality:** The belief in a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, with neither side becoming dominant. Neutral beings will cooperate with others as long as it is not to their own detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated, and believe in living by their own talents, rather than relying on others.

**Chaos:** The belief in evil and the meaninglessness and randomness of the universe, wherein the individual’s selfish desires are utmost. Chaotic beings lie and use others as is expedient to their own ends, with no concern for the good of the group. They casually break laws, and are driven by whims and the belief in luck.

## Revealing Alignment

The player must inform the referee of their character’s alignment, but does not have to tell other players.

## Role-Playing Alignment

Players should bear the chosen alignment in mind when determining their character’s actions. The referee may call the player’s attention to deeds that go against the chosen alignment, and may even suggest that the character change to an alignment better fitting to their behaviour. Deviation from alignment may also be penalised, as the referee sees fit.

## Languages

The native languages spoken by a player character are determined by the character’s class. These typically include the common tongue and an *alignment* language. Characters with high INT may learn additional languages (see *Ability Scores*).

## The Common Tongue

The common tongue (sometimes simply called **Common**) is a language which is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races—as well as many monsters—are able to speak Common.

In some settings, the referee may decide that different cultures in the campaign world use their own language, instead of Common. In this case, characters must choose to speak Common or a specific regional language.

## Alignment Languages

All intelligent beings know a secret, unwritten language of gestures, signs, and code words associated with their *alignment*. This secret language allows beings of the same alignment to communicate. Beings of another alignment will recognise when an alignment language is being used, but will not understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language except by changing alignment, in which case the former language is forgotten.

## Other Languages

Many demihuman and intelligent monster species have their own language, which player characters may be able to learn. The following languages are common and may be chosen by player characters with high Intelligence (at the referee’s discretion):

| d20 | Language        |
|-----|-----------------|
| 1   | *Bugbear*       |
| 2   | *Doppelgänger*  |
| 3   | *Dragon*        |
| 4   | Dwarvish        |
| 5   | Elvish          |
| 6   | *Gargoyle*      |
| 7   | *Gnoll*         |
| 8   | Gnomish         |
| 9   | *Goblin*        |
| 10  | *Halfling*      |
| 11  | *Harpy*         |
| 12  | *Hobgoblin*     |
| 13  | *Kobold*        |
| 14  | Lizard man      |
| 15  | *Medusa*        |
| 16  | *Minotaur*      |
| 17  | *Ogre*          |
| 18  | Orcish          |
| 19  | *Pixie*         |
| 20  | Human dialect   |

## Advancement

### Experience

All characters who survive an adventure and return to safety gain experience points (XP) due to any treasure recovered or monsters defeated. XP is awarded by the referee (see ''*Awarding XP*'').

#### Prime Requisite Modifiers

Characters with especially low or high scores in their class’ prime requisites receive a bonus or penalty to XP earned (see ''*Ability Scores*''). These modifiers are applied to the total XP gained by each character following an adventure.

#### Levelling Up

When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player should consult the description of the character’s class and note any improvements in saving throws, attack probabilities, spells per day, and other class abilities. If the character’s Hit Dice increase, a new Hit Die of the specified type should be rolled and the result added to the character’s maximum hit point total.

#### Maximum XP in One Session

Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Any additional XP that would take a character two or more levels above their current level are lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below the total for the next level.

### Level Titles

In some campaigns, characters gain the right to bear certain titles as they advance in level. Such titles may be granted by the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs are associates of. Level titles often vary greatly between campaign worlds, but the following lists may be used as inspiration:

* **Cleric:** Acolyte, Adept, Priest(ess), Vicar, Curate, Elder, Bishop, Lama, Matriarch (Patriarch).
* **Dwarf:** Dwarven Veteran, Dwarven Warrior, Dwarven Swordmaster, Dwarven Hero, Dwarven Swashbuckler, Dwarven Myrmidon, Dwarven Champion, Dwarven Superhero, Dwarven Lord (Lady).
* **Elf:** Medium/Veteran, Seer/Warrior, Conjurer/Swordmaster, Magician/Hero, Enchanter (Enchantress)/Swashbuckler, Warlock (Witch)/Myrmidon, Sorcerer (Sorceress)/Champion, Necromancer/Superhero, Wizard/Lord (Lady).
* **Fighter:** Veteran, Warrior, Swordmaster, Hero, Swashbuckler, Myrmidon, Champion, Superhero, Lord (Lady).
* **Halfling:** Halfling Veteran, Halfling Warrior, Halfling Swordmaster, Halfling Hero, Halfling Swashbuckler, Halfling Myrmidon, Halfling Champion, Sheriff.
* **Magic-user:** Medium, Seer, Conjurer, Magician, Enchanter (Enchantress), Warlock (Witch), Sorcerer (Sorceress), Necromancer, Wizard.
* **Thief:** Apprentice, Footpad, Robber, Burglar, Cutpurse, Sharper, Pilferer, Thief, Master Thief.

### High-Level Play (Optional Rule)

Human character classes are listed as having a maximum level of 14. This range of levels presents the best play experience, in terms of challenge and reward. Some groups, however, may wish to continue play into the extremely high levels beyond. This must be considered carefully, as demihuman PCs will be left behind, due to their strict level limits. If the referee allows continued play into higher levels, the following guidelines—allowing human characters to advance to a maximum of 36th level—may be used.

#### Clerics

*Cleric*s require an additional 100,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.

#### Fighters

*Fighter*s require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Fighters of 20th level may make two attacks per round. This increases to three attacks per round at 25th level and four per round at 30th level.

#### Magic-Users

Magic-users require an additional 150,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.

#### Thieves

Thieves require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Additional skills become available to high-level thieves, including the ability to climb upside down or horizontally, voice skills such as mimicry and ventriloquism, and other skills of deception.

| Fighter | Cleric, Thief | Magic-User | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
