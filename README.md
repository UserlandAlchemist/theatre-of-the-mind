# üé≠ Theatre of the Mind
*A text-based online game engine for exploring classic and remixed TTRPG adventures with interchangeable rulesets.*

## Design Tenets
- **Natural language first** ‚Äî players type as if speaking to a DM.  
- **Ruleset modularity** ‚Äî adjudication logic is pluggable and swappable.  
- **Content reskinnable** ‚Äî structure, lore, and stats are cleanly separated.  
- **Deterministic rules** ‚Äî adjudication is reproducible and auditable, even if natural-language parsing isn‚Äôt.  
- **Cost-aware LLM use** ‚Äî models are used lightly, with caching and templates to stay affordable.  
- **Scalable foundations** ‚Äî clean separation keeps migration paths open (e.g., microservices).

## Vision
Theatre of the Mind is a multiplayer, largely text-driven online game where players interact with adventures in **natural language**, as though speaking to a Dungeon Master.  

- **LLM-powered interpreter** converts free text into structured actions.  
- **Rules engine** adjudicates those actions according to the currently active ruleset (e.g., B/X, PF2e, homebrew).  
- **Adventure content** defines modules like *B1: In Search of the Unknown*, which can be played faithfully, reskinned, or transplanted into new settings.  

This creates both:  
- **Classic play**: authentic adventures under their original ruleset.  
- **Toolbox play**: experimentation with ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù scenarios ‚Äî new rulesets, settings, or remixed modules.

## Architecture Overview

Theatre of the Mind is layered to keep game logic portable and avoid lock-in:

- **Evennia (bootstrap layer)**  
  - Provides multiplayer connections (telnet/websocket), persistence, and account/session handling.  
  - Chosen to accelerate prototyping with a ready-made text game server.  
  - Treated as an **adapter**, not the core engine ‚Äî it can be replaced later if scaling demands it.  

- **Theatre Core (domain layer)**  
  - Independent Python package with:  
    - IR schema and validation.  
    - Rules controller + rulepacks.  
    - Adventure content loader (structure, lore, stats).  
    - Event store + replay.  
  - Ensures rules and adventures remain portable beyond Evennia.  

- **LLM Orchestrator**  
  - Converts natural language ‚Üí IR (JSON).  
  - Runs as a separate process, making it easy to swap models or distribute later.  

- **Rulepacks**  
  - `bx/`, `pf2/`, `homebrew/` etc. implement the adjudication interface.  
  - Translate neutral challenges into ruleset-specific mechanics.

## Adventure Content

Adventures are designed with **three conceptual layers**, kept distinct so they can be recombined:

- **Structure** ‚Äî the skeleton: maps, rooms, connections, triggers, and challenge bands (e.g., ‚Äúeasy check‚Äù vs ‚Äúhard check‚Äù), without ruleset-specific numbers.  
- **Lore** ‚Äî the words, names, and story flavor. Multiple variants can exist (e.g., original module text, paraphrased safe text, alternate settings).  
- **Stats** ‚Äî the ruleset-specific numbers (monster stat blocks, trap DCs, treasure values), expressed per ruleset.  

This separation allows:  
- Running the same adventure under multiple rulesets without duplication.  
- Reskinning modules into different settings while keeping mechanics intact.  
- Preserving authenticity (original lore + original stats) while enabling remix play (alternate lore + different ruleset).

## Rulesets & Flexibility

A core goal of *Theatre of the Mind* is to **experience how rulesets shape play**.  

- Implementing different rulesets (e.g., B/X, 3.5e, PF2e) shows how mechanics evolved over time.  
- Running a classic module in its original ruleset captures historical authenticity.  
- Swapping in a modern ruleset reveals how later design choices change pacing, challenge, and narrative.  
- Reskinning a module into a different setting shows how **lore and mechanics interact**.  

This isn‚Äôt about rigid ‚Äúmodes of play.‚Äù Instead, it‚Äôs a **toolbox**:  
- Choose a module.  
- Choose a ruleset.  
- Choose a lore/setting skin.  
- ‚Ä¶and see how those choices transform the experience.

## Persistence & Player Interaction

The system supports:  
- **Solo play** (one player controlling multiple characters).  
- **Small-party multiplayer.**  
- **Optional DM presence** (via reserved commands or narrative input).  

Adventures can run as **per-party instances** (replayable, fair), with optional future support for **shared or persistent spaces** (where multiple parties‚Äô actions affect the same world).

## LLM Usage & Cost Strategy

As a hobby project, LLM usage must remain **affordable and efficient**.  

- **Interpretation only:**  
  - LLMs parse natural language into IR.  
  - Rules engine and templates handle adjudication and narration.  

- **Lightweight models by default:**  
  - Smaller/cheaper models (or local ones) handle routine parsing.  
  - Larger models only for richer narrative, if needed.  

- **Cache and reuse:**  
  - Store `(utterance ‚Üí IR)` mappings to avoid repeated LLM calls.  
  - Template narration where possible.  

- **Tight context windows:**  
  - Only relevant state is passed to the LLM.  
  - Retrieval supplies precise lore/stats instead of whole modules.  

- **Predictable costs:**  
  - One action ‚âà 200‚Äì300 tokens.  
  - Multi-hour sessions should cost only cents with small models.  
  - Token usage per session is logged for visibility.  

---

## Scaling Philosophy
- **Now:** One Evennia server with adventure bundles.  
- **Later:** Keep `theatre_core` pure and portable, define JSON contracts, and design around stable IDs.  
- This ensures migration to custom servers or microservices is possible without rewriting adventures or rules.  

---

## Legal & Content Strategy
- **For private/testing:** classic modules and rulesets may be used.  
- **For public/shareable:** provide paraphrased lore, open-content SRD mechanics, or original settings.  
- Grey content is kept in isolated lore/stats files so it can be swapped out cleanly.  

---

## Near-Term Goal
The first milestone is modest but foundational:  
- Play through one module (*B1: In Search of the Unknown*)  
- Using its original ruleset (B/X)  
- With content converted into machine-readable form (structure + lore + stats).  

This validates the **utterance ‚Üí IR ‚Üí adjudication ‚Üí narration** pipeline and proves that Evennia + Theatre Core can deliver a complete playable adventure loop.

## Summary
Theatre of the Mind is:  
- A **learning project** and **personal play space.**  
- An **engine/toolbox** for experimenting with modules and rulesets.  
- Built for both **nostalgia** (classic adventures) and **experimentation** (remixes, ruleset swaps).  
- Designed to keep **LLM usage affordable** and rules deterministic.  
- Architected so it can grow from ‚Äúone server, one dungeon‚Äù to larger worlds without painful rewrites.
