# Theatre of the Mind

A text-based online game engine for exploring classic and remixed TTRPG adventures with interchangeable rulesets.

## Overview
Theatre of the Mind lets players type as if speaking to a Dungeon Master.
Your words are parsed into structured actions, adjudicated by a modular rules engine, and narrated back in natural language.

- Natural-language input — conversational play
- Modular rulesets — swap between B/X, BECMI, homebrew, etc.
- Adventure remixing — structure, lore, and stats are cleanly separated
- Built on [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/) for multiplayer and persistence


## Status
Early development.
The first milestone is to play through *B1: In Search of the Unknown* under its original B/X ruleset, with content converted into machine-readable form.
